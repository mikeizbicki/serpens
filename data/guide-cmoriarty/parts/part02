2.) Bombs and the Blue Candle 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the start of the game, at coordinate H8, we're going to travel around 
Hyrule to get three pieces of heart that'll bring our total up to six, which is 
more than ample for the first dungeon. But first, we need to get the Blue 
Candle and some Bombs, so that we can physically get these hearts.

From the origin, head one screen left. Here, there are four Tektites. Kill them 
afar with your sword beams (pending you have full hearts), and take whatever 
rupees they drop. Then go north, and kill the four red Octoroks, taking 
whatever they drop as well. Enter the cave on screen to find a store. A little 
over-priced, yes, but they have the Blue Candle. It's 60 rupees here, so now 
you know how much you have to save.

Head back to the origin (H8), and go all the way east of the origin, along the 
coastline. Fight all the enemies you see, and take whatever rupees they drop. 
It's all important, whether it's one rupee or five. When you get all the way 
east and you can't go east any more, head north. You'll be at coordinate G16 on 
the map when you go east all the way and up one. Here should be a cave at the 
north part of the screen. Enter the cave to find another store. This store has 
bombs, which we need. Spend the 20 rupees and purchase the Bombs. The Magic 
Shield here is only 130 rupees, but we'll come back for that later.

Now all you have to do is run back and forth between this area and the origin, 
and gather 60 rupees. Once you do, hit up the first store we went to at G7 and 
buy the Blue Candle! Now we can get these hearts!
