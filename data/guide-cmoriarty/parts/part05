5.) The Old Woman's Letter 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Old Woman's Letter is an important item, because it allows you to buy 
medicine that refills your hearts, all over the world of Hyrule. From the shop 
we were just in, head south, then west, then south, than east, then south, then 
east again, and you'll be back at the origin. Now, head east from the origin a 
few screens, to where we got the first heart container, at coordinate H12. 
Right next to the secret cave entrance where the heart container was located is 
a path heading north. Head north along this path to the next screen, and keep 
heading north, through the desert region, until you hit a dead end, and can't 
go north anymore. From here, head right one screen, and we'll be where the 
second heart container was hidden. From here, head right one screen. On this 
next screen are a barrage of enemies... kill them if you want, but ignore the 
staircase leading up. Instead, head north along the passageway that's got water 
touching it. In this area, there is another staircase leading up. Ignore it and 
head right. Now, the staircase HERE is the one you want to take up. Kill the 
Tektites and go up the stairs. Enter the cave at the top of the stairs, and 
take the letter from the Old Man. Woo, now we got the letter! Now all we need 
to do is get the Blue Ring, and we'll be ready for the first dungeon!
