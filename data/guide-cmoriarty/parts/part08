8.) Getting to the second dungeon...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you're teleported outside of the first dungeon, it is indeed time to go to 
the second dungeon. We're wasting no time here, baby! Head back to the origin 
(go east across the bridge, and then south all the way until you can't go south 
anymore. From there, head west one screen, and you'll be at the origin).

From the origin, head east 8 screens, until you can't go east anymore. Then, 
head north one screen, and from there, go west through that screen. Follow the 
path leading upward two screens, and then head west again. Go north up the 
staircase here, and you'll be at level 2, which on my map, is located at 
coordinate D13, in case you get lost.

Optionally, before you embark on this dungeon, if you need potions, go see the 
old woman ar coordinate G5, the one we saw before we went to the first dungeon, 
if you want any refills or what have you. If you're all set, then lets do this!
