14.) The Magical Sword
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Magical Sword is the next thing on our list to get. It's twice as powerful 
as the White Sword we have equipped now, making it four times stronger than the 
Wooden Sword. In otherwords, it's very, very strong. There are requirements to 
get it, however, which is why I waited until now to get it. You must have 12 
hearts in your reserves, which we have now. So, once back in the graveyard, 
simply go up one screen, and we'll be in the right place. There are 12 graves 
on each screen, correct? Go to the vertical row second to the right, and then 
the middle row horizontally. Push the grave there from the bottom upwards. A 
staircase will be hidden underneath of it. Go down the staircase, and grab the 
Magical Sword from the old man! WOOHAH! Now THAT'S the ticket, baby. (note: The 
Magic Sword, on my map, is at coordinate C2.)

Anyway, once you get the Magical Sword (oh the power!), head all the way back 
to the origin. Once you're back there, we can head to the next dungeon, dungeon 
five. To get there from the origin, go right one screen, then up all the way 
until you can't go up anymore. From there, go left, then up, then left again, 
and you'll be near Death Mountain, where all of the rocks fall on you and 
whatnot. Go right many a screen until you notice that the screen is repeating 
itself. Go up the stairs into Death Mountain, and go up the stairs four times 
(the screen'll look the same, but it's not), and you'll hear the famous Zelda 
secret tone. Enter Dungeon five, and get ready for some fun. Or not.
