NOTE: To thank, right away, Astro Blue and Shdwrlm3 for allowing me to use two 
parts of their Zelda: OoS/OoA FAQ - the Triforce section header and their 
dungeon layout/grid system. Thanks to you both, and make sure to check out 
their great FAQs as well!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This FAQ, and all 25 other of my FAQ/Walkthroughs, are now dedicated to the 
over 6,000 innocent people killed in the World Trade Center and Pentagon 
terrorist attacks in New York City, New York, and Washington, D.C., on 
September 11, 2001. To all of the innocent working people, and FDNY Firemen, as 
well as other emergency workers, you will always be remembered. We won't stop 
until we bring these criminals to justice, your deaths were NOT IN VAIN! God 
Bless America, death to all terrorists of all races everywhere.

Percent Complete: 100%
Version Entails: Appendices and walkthrough complete up through the first 
quest. 
Still To Come: After much diliberation, I've decided that I won't be doing the 
second quest to include in this FAQ/Walkthrough. So basically, it's a guide 
that covers the first quest exclusively. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it 
goes...

--PAST VERSIONS--

Version: 2.0

Percent Complete: 70%
Version Entails: Appendices and walkthrough complete up through the first 
quest.
Still To Come: Now that the first quest (the primary game that everyone who 
plays Zelda plays) is done as far as the walkthrough goes, and the appendices 
remain the same for the second quest, all I have to do is do the second quest 
walkthrough, which could very well take awhile. I could start doing it 
tomorrow, or I could do it over the summer - who knows? Basically, the most 
important part of the walkthrough is done, and that is a comprehensive 
walkthrough for the first quest, with appendices galore for the first quest. 
The second quest isn't a necessary thing to play through, and so I'm gonna put 
it off for now... I got another walkthrough (Mega Man 6) I gotta finish up and 
finalize, and then we'll see where I'm at. Thanks for reading,

Welcome one, welcome all, to my The Legend of Zelda FAQ, for the classic 1986 
Nintendo game that started one of the greatest videogame series of all time!

Being the original Zelda game, the mechanics of the game have been mimiced by 
many games since, but none have quite got it down to the art and science that 
Nintendo got it to with The Legend of Zelda. The game is a true classic. The 
characters, monsters, et cetera, have been appearing in Zelda games ever since 
this game was released, all over every Nintendo platform, including another on 
the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), one on the SNES (Super Nintendo 
Entertainment System), one on the Game Boy, which was later put in color for 
the Game Boy Color, two on the Nintendo64, and one upcoming for the Gamecube in 
late 2002, early 2003.

So here we are, within a FAQ of an original NES game, that spawned so many 
sequels that it MUST be good, right? Well trust me, it is. And my FAQ is here 
to help you get through this game, which can be harder than you probably know. 
If you want to find everything, you'll probably need some help, and that's what 
my FAQ is here for. Enjoy, and if you have any questions or comments, 
complaints or suggestions, please feel free to e-mail me.

Enjoy!

Like any good piece of literature, a good video game has a good plot, a good 
storyline. Well below is the storyline of The Legend of Zelda, a storyline that 
has basically been re-used in every Zelda game since (although they add little 
twists and turns along the way, of course). The below story is NOT in my own 
words, it's straight out of The Legend of Zelda instruction manual that came 
with the game, and is (c) Nintendo, 1986. Again, these aren't my words, these 
are Nintendo's, but are put in the FAQ to give you, the reader, who may not 
have an instruction manual, and may not know the story of Zelda some insight 
before you play the game. It gives the game more depth.

A LONG, LONG TIME AGO THE WORLD WAS IN AN AGE OF CHAOS.

In the midst of this chaos, in a little kingdom in theland of Hyrule, a legend 
was being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of the 
"Triforce"; golden triangles possessing mystical powers. One day, an evil army 
attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This 
army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the 
World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, 
the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom ino eight 
fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce 
from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most 
trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man 
with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew 
angry, imprisoner the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.

Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she 
reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon's 
evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A 
young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa 
from a fate worse than death.

His name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and Ganon's 
henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess Zelda and the evil 
Ganon. Buring with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon 
was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of power. And so, in order to 
fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the 
Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn't do 
this, there would be no change Link could fight his way into Death Mountain 
where Ganon lived.

Can Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda? 

Only your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.

(above story copyrighted to Nintendo, (c) 1986)

   /\                                                                     /\

There are really only three characters in Zelda, but there are five 
descriptions below (go figure). The five descriptions below are of the five 
main characters in the game (although you only play as one). Enjoy.

>>>Link
Link is the main character in the game, the character synonomous with all Zelda 
games. He is considerably young in this game, as he is in all the games, and is 
equipped at the beginning with a mere wooden sword and wooden shield. His 
ability to fight doesn't lie in his strength or age, however, but in his 
undying courage, and urge to do the right thing, to help all of humanity defeat 
Ganon and his evil followers. Being that Link is 16 in Zelda II, I'd say Link 
is maybe 12 in this game.

>>>Ganon
Ganon is the evil bad guy in all of the Zelda games. Later called Ganondorf, 
Ganon takes control of the Triforce of Strength/Power and attempts to gain 
control of the entire world in this game. In this game, you have to get through 
eight dungeons guarded by eight of his strongest henchmen, before you gain 
access to his own dungeon, the heavily guarded, the huge Death Mountain.

>>>Princess Zelda
Ah yes, Princess Zelda. For whatever reason, the folks at Nintendo decided it 
crucial to name the game series after her (causing a whole lot of confusion... 
yes, there are still people out there who think that Link is Zelda... go 
figure). Zelda, after sending Impa out to find a hero willing to battle Ganon, 
gets kidnapped when Ganon catches wind of her plot. Now it's up to Link to save 
the beautiful maiden!

>>>Impa
Impa isn't exactly in the game, but she plays a crucial role in the storyline 
of the game, as mentioned in the above plot/storyline section of the FAQ. Impa 
is sent out to find a hero (Link) to battle Ganon, by Princess Zelda. With 
Ganon's henchmen trailing her the entire time, Impa finds Link just in time, as 
Ganon's baddies catch up with her, and Link slays them just in time!

>>>Old Man
The Old Man is all over the game. Whether he is one person or several is widely 
unknown by everyone (there's no proof going either way), but one thing is for 
certain - he wants to help you out. He gives you the Wooden Sword in the 
beginning of the game, and gives you hints in each dungeon, if you can find 
him. But don't hack him with your sword, or the statues guarding him will fire 
at you!

Obviously the controls for the game aren't going to be too complicated, as the 
NES controller is very basic. Below is an ASCII model of the NES controller, 
and after that, explanations of what each button do. Okay? Coolio.

The Directional Pad (D-Pad) - Move Link up, down, left and right anywhere in 
the game. Also, you can use the D-Pad to navigate the sub-menu (which is gotten 
to by pressing start), and other such goodness. It's a straight-forward button, 
is it not?

A Button - The A Button's primary function is to hack and slash with your 
sword. It's that simple. =)

B Button - If you have special weapons/items/accessories equipped on you via 
the sub-menu, this is the button to press to use and/or activate the equipped 
item.

Start Button - Press this button to bring up the sub-screen in the game.

Select Button - A lot of NES games don't utilize the Select button, yes... but 
many early NES games, like The Legend of Zelda, do, and in this game, you can 
press Select to pause the game, and then restart it from where you paused.

The game physics and mechanics of the game aren't too hard. The game, being 
pretty primitive by today's standards, is straight-forward and easy to get the 
hang of. Plus, there are so many games that mimic the unique stylings of The 
Legend of Zelda, that you've almost certainly played a game like it, even if 
you've never actually played a Zelda game.

You walk around, you hack and fight enemies, gather items and rupees (the 
monetary unit in Hyrule) and enter one of the nine dungeons (in order, 
preferably), to get new items, beat bosses, and advance farther into the game. 
It's really that simple. You never have more than one view, which is an over-
head view of the game. The game is split into "squares" for easy programming, 
with each square having certain enemies and whatnot, that are special to that 
square. Having the over-head view of each square gives you the advantage to see 
an entire square without having to move.

The game map is a vital part of the FAQ, and should be used in relation to the 
walkthrough at all points. There will be coordinates (i.e. A6) all over the 
walkthrough, which, unless in a dungeon (which you should use the dunegon map), 
is in reference to this map! The map is 8 sections high (vertically), and 16 
sections long (horizontally). The vertical sectors will be named by a letter (A 
through H), and the horizontal sectors will be named by a number (1 through 
16). Hence, A1, A2, et cetera.

And now, the walkthrough. But before we get down to the nitty-gritty, lets go 
over a few vitals that you should all probably be aware of.

1.) Saving is easy, saving is fundamental. But when you save and shut off your 
NES, make sure to hold in the reset button, so you don't lose that saved data! 
NESes are retarded like that!

2.) When you die on the overworld, you start back at the original screen in the 
game, at coordinate H8 on the map. If you die in the dungeon, you restart at 
the beginning of that particular dungeon.

3.) The walkthrough is written in such a way that I always went through the 
game since I was a kid. There are other walkthroughs on GameFAQs if you don't 
like the way I go through the game. Some play it like I do, some don't, I'm 
sure, so to each his own. This is the way I think it's easiest to get through 
the game.

4.) Keep an eye on your hearts, and if you're dangerously low ("beep, beep"), 
make sure to get your hearts or you're gonna perish, boy!

5.) Rupees are vital. You're definetly going to want to collect all the rupees 
enemies drop... you never know when you're going to need them. Or maybe you do, 
I don't know. =)

And now, the walkthrough...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) The Beginning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Y'know, I get all nostalgic every time I begin a new adventure in Zelda. It's 
sad, really.

Anyway... as the game begins, move Link to the cave at the top of the screen 
and enter it. The old man there, with his famous words, "It's dangerous to go 
alone! Take this," will give you the Wooden Sword. But we won't have it for 
long, so don't worry about a thing. =) There's so much to do before we go to 
the first dungeon.

The way I see it, most Zelda players choose to go right to the first dungeon, 
but it's pointless. You can get three heart pieces and a stronger sword before 
you ever even go to the first dungeon. Being that this is true, why waste your 
time? Do it this way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.) Bombs and the Blue Candle 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the start of the game, at coordinate H8, we're going to travel around 
Hyrule to get three pieces of heart that'll bring our total up to six, which is 
more than ample for the first dungeon. But first, we need to get the Blue 
Candle and some Bombs, so that we can physically get these hearts.

From the origin, head one screen left. Here, there are four Tektites. Kill them 
afar with your sword beams (pending you have full hearts), and take whatever 
rupees they drop. Then go north, and kill the four red Octoroks, taking 
whatever they drop as well. Enter the cave on screen to find a store. A little 
over-priced, yes, but they have the Blue Candle. It's 60 rupees here, so now 
you know how much you have to save.

Head back to the origin (H8), and go all the way east of the origin, along the 
coastline. Fight all the enemies you see, and take whatever rupees they drop. 
It's all important, whether it's one rupee or five. When you get all the way 
east and you can't go east any more, head north. You'll be at coordinate G16 on 
the map when you go east all the way and up one. Here should be a cave at the 
north part of the screen. Enter the cave to find another store. This store has 
bombs, which we need. Spend the 20 rupees and purchase the Bombs. The Magic 
Shield here is only 130 rupees, but we'll come back for that later.

Now all you have to do is run back and forth between this area and the origin, 
and gather 60 rupees. Once you do, hit up the first store we went to at G7 and 
buy the Blue Candle! Now we can get these hearts!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.) Getting the Three Heart Pieces 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get to the first heart, go from the cave, back to the origin, by going 
south, than east. Head east all the way through until the first screen where 
there's a coastline. Only the bottom righthand corner'll have coastline, but 
this is the right place. Kill all of the Lynels so that there is no 
disturbance, except from the Zola in the water. Equip the bombs to the A button 
and bomb the wall to the left of the path leading up. When you bomb this area, 
a cave will appear. Enter the cave, and the old man will offer you a heart 
container or a Red Potion. Of course, take the heart container.

From this location (H12), head north along the path all the way 'til you get to 
the desert region, and you can't go north anymore. Along your way, kill or 
avoid the Goriyas, it's up to you. When you get to the desert regions, Lynels 
and Peahats are all over the place, so kill them to rack up some rupees. When 
you reach the deadend heading north, go right one screen, to coordinate C13. 
Kill the four Tektites in the area to free the area of any annoyances, and 
approach the large rock formation in the middle of the screen. Bomb the lower 
righthand side of the formation, and a cave entrance will appear. Again, enter 
it and choose the Heart Container from the old man, which now gives us five 
hearts. One more to get!

Okay, now, the third heart that we need to get. From the origin, go right one 
screen, and then head up all the way until you reach a screen which has water 
in the upper right hand corner. This is at coordinate E9. From here, head right 
one screen (E8), where there'll be water at the top of the screen and you'll be 
on a short passageway which only heads horizontally along the screen. From the 
right, where you enter the screen, count over five bushes. Stand back from the 
bush, and use the Blue Candle on it, to burn it away, which will reveal a 
hidden staircase. Descend the staircase, and take the heart from the old man, 
which now gives us six hearts! Woohah! Alright, now to take care of some other 
business.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.) Getting the White Sword and the Magic Shield 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we can already update our weapon and armor situation, and we haven't even 
hit the first dungeon yet! The deal is, we need six hearts to get the White 
Sword, which is twice as strong as the Wooden Sword we have equipped on Link 
now. Well, now that we have six hearts, we can get the White Sword, so lets do 
so now, shall we?

From the screen where we got the heart piece just before, at coordinate E8, 
head right to E9, and then go up one screen, past the bridge heading west, and 
up another screen. You'll be in a place filled with pesky Peahats, which you 
can only kill when they are perfectly still, so don't waste your time. Instead, 
head left from here, then up on the next screen, avoiding more Peahats. You'll 
be in the Death Mountain region now, which is dangerous, with all of the 
falling Rocks. Move quickly and avoid them the best you can... they do massive 
damage, and can't be harmed or hindered by any weapon. Shoot right a few 
screens until you get to a screen which has a staircase leading into Death 
Mountain. Kill the Tektites on this screen and go up the stairs. Here, there'll 
be a pond in the middle of the screen, with a Zola in it, and a Blue Lynel 
patrolling around it. Kill or avoid the Lynel (they do a lot of damage, so be 
careful!), and enter the cave there. Talk to the old man and he'll give you the 
White Sword! Now to get the Magic Shield. 

At coordinate G16, there's a place that sells the Magic Shield for 130, but we 
can get it for 40 rupees cheaper somewhere else... you just have to know where 
to look. From the cave where you just got the White Sword, head back down the 
stairs, and then head back west, then south, back to the origin. From the 
origin, head west one screen, then north one screen, then west again, then 
north again, and then, finally, east. You should come out in a screen that has 
some bushes in the center area of the screen. Have the Blue Candle equipped, 
and make sure you have 90 rupees. If you don't have 90 rupees, run around and 
fight some enemies until you do. Once that goal is reached, head north one more 
screen, and burn the bush that's on the corner of the bushes going horizontally 
and vertically, along the pathway. Enter the hidden stairway that is revealed, 
and purchase the Magic Shield from the merchant, for 90 rupees! Sweet deal!

Now, there are only a few more things we need to do. First, lets get the 
Letter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.) The Old Woman's Letter 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Old Woman's Letter is an important item, because it allows you to buy 
medicine that refills your hearts, all over the world of Hyrule. From the shop 
we were just in, head south, then west, then south, than east, then south, then 
east again, and you'll be back at the origin. Now, head east from the origin a 
few screens, to where we got the first heart container, at coordinate H12. 
Right next to the secret cave entrance where the heart container was located is 
a path heading north. Head north along this path to the next screen, and keep 
heading north, through the desert region, until you hit a dead end, and can't 
go north anymore. From here, head right one screen, and we'll be where the 
second heart container was hidden. From here, head right one screen. On this 
next screen are a barrage of enemies... kill them if you want, but ignore the 
staircase leading up. Instead, head north along the passageway that's got water 
touching it. In this area, there is another staircase leading up. Ignore it and 
head right. Now, the staircase HERE is the one you want to take up. Kill the 
Tektites and go up the stairs. Enter the cave at the top of the stairs, and 
take the letter from the Old Man. Woo, now we got the letter! Now all we need 
to do is get the Blue Ring, and we'll be ready for the first dungeon!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.) The Blue Ring
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting the Blue Ring isn't too hard, and it's a useful item, for it cuts out 
half of the damage done by enemies, helping Link persevere in battle longer. It 
is a pricey item, however, at 250 rupees. It takes a long time to save that 
much up, but you have to. There are hidden locations of rupee stashes all over 
Hyrule, but we should save them for later, when we really need them. So for 
now, head all the way back down to the origin (it's a long way, just re-trace 
your steps and you'll be back there in no time at all).

From the origin, go up one screen. Then, go left several screens until you come 
to a screen that has a cave on it. This cave holds an old woman that sells 
Medicine, but we'll go to here after we get the Blue Ring. Go up and you'll be 
near a body of water. Go up one more screen and there is a cave on this screen 
which has a shop. Nothing of any importance there, however. Once you hit the 
250 rupee total we need for the Blue Ring, go up one more screen, to a screen 
with six Armos' on it. Touch the Armos in the middle of the top row. He'll walk 
away and underneath him will be a staircase. Descend the staircase to find a 
secret store! Within the store, of course, is the Blue Ring. Make the purchase, 
and we're now ready for the first dungeon!

Optionally, you can head back down to coordinate G5 before going to the first 
dungeon, and pick up some Magic Potion, for 68 rupees, which refills your 
hearts, now that we have the Letter, from the old woman we passed up before. 
It's a good buy, and you should probably swing by there before hitting up the 
first dungeon. If you don't want to, however, that's fine, too.

Head back to the origin when you're all set, and then we'll go from there to 
the first dungeon. Go right one screen, and then up that screen all the way 
until you hit water. Once there is water in the upper right hand corner of the 
screen you come across, go north one more screen, and there'll be a bridge 
heading westward. Cross the bridge to the island, and enter the dungeon from 
there.

Ah yes, welcome to the first dungeon. Now we actually get to do the fun part of 
Zelda, "dungeon crawl." Enter the dungeon, and lets get to work.

1.) F3 (entrance) - When you enter the dungeon, you can go left, right, or up. 
First, go right.

2.) F4 - This room has five Stalfos' within it. One of them holds a Key. Kill 
all five of them, regardless of if you kill the one with the Key before they 
all die. Collect everything they drop, not forgetting the Key, and then head 
back to F3.

3.) F3 - Shoot across the room leftward to F2.

4.) F2 - In this room, there are three Keeses (Bat enemies). Kill them, being 
weary to not run into them. When you defeat all three of them, a Key will 
appear at the bottom of the screen. Grab it and head back to F3.

5.) F3 - Now, go up to the door at the top of the room and use a Key on it to 
open it. Shoot into E3.

6.) E3 - In this room, simply kill the three Stalfos enemies that patrol it, 
gather whatever they drop, and go north, to D3.

7.) D3 - In this room, there are five Stalfos'. Kill all five of them, and a 
Key will appear in the room. Grab the Key, as well as anything the Stalfos 
dropped after you defeated them, and then head right, to D4.

8.) D4 - There are a bunch of Keeses in this room, but also, there is the 
Compass, which puts the bosses location on your dungeon map (which we haven't 
gotten yet.) Kill all the Keeses and gather whatever they drop after they are 
killed, and grab the Compass they were guarding. Then head back to D3.

9.) D3 - Shoot leftward across the room to D2.

10.) D2 - As you enter this room, the door will slam shut behind you. Kill all 
the Keeses that are in the room, and grab whatever the drop. When they are all 
defeated, the door will open up behind you. Ignore it, and go to the locked 
door at the north of the room, and unlock it. Head upward to C2.

11.) C2 - In this room, kill the three weak Gel enemies that are in the room, 
and grab whatever they happen to drop. If you want to hear a hint from the 
infamous Old Man of Zelda, push the block in the middle of the room from the 
left rightward, and the door to the left will open. 

12.) C1 - The old man in here will tell you that the "eastmost penninsula is 
the secret." Note they spelt "peninsula" wrong, adding an extra 'n'. Then, head 
back to C2.

13.) C2 - Shoot across the room to the right, entering C3.

14.) C3 - In this room, there are several Gels. Kill all the Gels, grab what 
they drop, and then grab the Map at the righthand side of the room. Now you 
have an idea of where you're going, although my map at the top of this section 
is far better then the one the game supplies you with. In anycase, after you do 
all of that, open the door to the right with your remaining key, and enter into 
C4.

15.) C4 - In this room, there are three Goriyas, chucking their boomerangs in 
all directions. Get in close to each of them and kill them with your White 
Sword, and when they are all defeated, a Boomerang will appear at the top of 
the screen. Grab it and play with it a bit if you want, and then head back left 
to C3. The enemy is the other way, yes, but we still have more to do here 
before we engage in battle.

16.) C3 - Shoot up to the door at the top, going to B3.

17.) B3 - This room is a walkway surrounded by water. On the walkway are three 
Stalfos. Kill them all and take the Key one of them drops, as well as anything 
else they drop of interest to you. Use it to open the door at the north of the 
room, leading to A3.

18.) A3 - In this water-filled room, there are three Goriyas hunting you. Be 
weary as you get in close to them, and kill them with your White Sword. One of 
them will drop a Key, so grab it, and anything else they drop, and then open 
the door at the left of the room with the Key you just got, leading to A2.

19.) A2 - As you enter this room, be careful of the traps! Walk into the room 
and around the block formation in the middle, to the left side of the room. 
Push the leftmost block upward to gain passage to the staircase in the middle, 
and go down the stairs, to B2.

20.) B2 - Down here, avoid or destroy the four Keeses, and grab the Bow from 
the catacombs. Then, head back up the ladder to A2.

21.) A2 - Head right, avoiding the traps again, back to A3.

22.) A3 - Head south from here, down to B3.

23.) B3 - Head south again, to C3.

24.) C3 - Head right, to the room where we got the boomerang, C4.

25.) C4 - Head right again, killing the Goriyas, to C5.

26.) C5 - In this room, you can hear the cries of the dungeon boss, Aquamentus. 
You have to grab the final Key in the dungeon from the south of the room, but 
avoid the hand enemies, Wall Masters. If they touch you, they'll drag you all 
the way back to the entrance of the dungeon, and then you'll have to work your 
way all the way back here. Grab the key and open the door at the north of the 
room. Enter B5, the boss chamber.

27.) B5 - Aquamentus' Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - A Q U A M E N T U S

Aquamentus is the first boss battle in the game, and is pretty easy to defeat. 
If you're really low on hearts, use the red/blue potion in your inventory if 
you have either. If not, then just risk it with what you've got. If you have 
full heart energy, you can shoot sword beams at Aquamentus from afar, but it's 
easier to avoid the triple fireballs he shoots at you, and slash him up close 
with the White Sword, for full effect. With the White Sword, he only takes 
three hits before he is defeated. Just avoid the fireballs he shoots and use 
the fact that he's a very stationary enemy to your advantage. If you do get hit 
with his fireballs, don't fret it. With the Blue Ring equipped, he only does 
half a heart of damage. 

After Aquamentus is defeated, go right, to room B6.

28.) B6 - Grab the Triforce from the center of the room, which will refill your 
hearts, and then you automatically leave the completed dungeon. 
Congratulations!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.) Getting to the second dungeon...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you're teleported outside of the first dungeon, it is indeed time to go to 
the second dungeon. We're wasting no time here, baby! Head back to the origin 
(go east across the bridge, and then south all the way until you can't go south 
anymore. From there, head west one screen, and you'll be at the origin).

From the origin, head east 8 screens, until you can't go east anymore. Then, 
head north one screen, and from there, go west through that screen. Follow the 
path leading upward two screens, and then head west again. Go north up the 
staircase here, and you'll be at level 2, which on my map, is located at 
coordinate D13, in case you get lost.

Optionally, before you embark on this dungeon, if you need potions, go see the 
old woman ar coordinate G5, the one we saw before we went to the first dungeon, 
if you want any refills or what have you. If you're all set, then lets do this!

This, the second dungeon in the game, is shaped like a Moon. It's just as 
straight forward as the first dungeon, however, except for some tougher 
enemies... that's ALL! So here weeee go!

1.) H2 (entrance) - Once you enter the entrance, you can go up, or you can go 
east. First, go east, to room H3.

2.) H3 - Once in this room, kill all the Ropes (snake enemies) in the room. 
They move really fast, so be on your toes as you engage them in battle! Pick up 
what they drop, and when you defeat them all, a key will appear. Pick up the 
key. Go back to H2.

3.) H2 - Go up now, to G2.

4.) G2 - Once in G2, there are more Ropes for you to fight. Kill all the Ropes 
in the room, and you'll notice that the closed door to the left of the room 
will shoot open. Go into that room, which is G1.

5.) G1 - Here in G1, kill all the Ropes in here as well, taking whatever they 
drop after you kill them. Once they all die, take the key in the room that they 
were guarding. After you get the key and kill all the Ropes, head right, back 
to G2.

6.) G2 - Shoot straight across this room now, to the door at the right, which 
leads to G3.

7.) G3 - Kill the three Ropes patrolling the room, gathering whatever they 
drop. The door leading south leads to a room we've already been to, so ignore 
it. The door leading right is locked and the door leading up isn't... first, go 
right, to the locked door. Use a key on it, and enter G4.

8.) G4 - In here, there is a Compass on the righthand side of the room. Kill 
the plethora of Gels surrounding it, gathering whatever thingies they drop. 
Then grab the Compass, and head back left, to G3.

9.) G3 - Head north, now, to F3.

10.) F3 - In this room, there is a crapload of boomerang-chucking Goriyas for 
you to contend with. Take them out as quickly as possible, sustaining as little 
damage as you possibly can. When they're all taken out, and you gather up 
whatever they drop, unlock the door to your right, leading into F4.

11.) F4 - Here, this room is just like G4, except instead of the Compass being 
guarded by the Gels, it's the dungeon Map. Do the same exact thing you did back 
in G4, taking out the Gels, and then grab the Map. Once the Map is had, head 
back to F3.

12.) F3 - Head north through the door, leading to E3.

13.) E3 - Once you enter into E3, the door behind you will shut. The only way 
to open it is to kill all the Ropes in the room. Although there's no need for 
you to go back, you should still kill all the Ropes for all the items they 
drop... plus, they hold a Key once they are all defeated. So defeat them all, 
grab the key, and then head right, to E4.

14.) E4 - E4 is a pretty hectic room, so make sure that when you enter it, 
you're ready to fight. There is a statue in each corner of the room, constantly 
shooting fireballs at Link. In addition to that, there are three blue Goriyas 
chucking boomerangs in the room. Avoid the fireballs and kill the Goriyas. When 
you kill the three Goriyas, they drop the Magic Boomerang. The only difference 
between the regular Boomerang and the Magic Boomerang is how far the Magic 
Boomerang can fly in relation to the regular Boomerang. When you get the 
Boomerang, head left, back to E3.

15.) E3 - Head north through the door, leading to D3.

16.) D3 - In this desert room, two Moldorms will appear. These fireball snake 
creatures are slow moving and easy to attack. Each time you attack them, you 
take off the balls on their body, how many depending on how well you hit the 
Moldorm. Once you defeat the two Moldorms here, a key appears in the center of 
the room. Grab the key, and then head to the right, to D4.

17.) D4 - As soon as you enter D4, be careful of the traps shooting at you! 
This room is full of Keeses. In the center of the room are some bombs, if you 
need them. If you don't need them, you can just ignore this room all together. 
If you did come here, head back to D3 now.

18.) D3 - Head north through the door, leading to C3.

19.) C3 - As you enter this room, the door behind you slams shut. Kill all the 
Ropes in this room (there are many), and grab all the goodies that they drop 
after they are defeated. You'll notice that the room to your right is locked. 
Open the door there with a key and enter it, leading to room C4.

20.) C4 - In C4, kill all the weak Gel enemies, and five rupees will appear in 
the center of the room for you to take, in addition to whatever else the Gels 
dropped when you slayed them. After that, head through the door to the north, 
to B4.

21.) B4 - In this room, the old man of the dungeon is, to give you a clue. He 
says, "Dodongo dislikes smoke" in reference to the boss enemy, Dodongo, in this 
dungeon, whose weakness is bombs. (hence: smoke). Head back south to C4 after 
you talk to the old man.

22.) C4 - Head back left, to the door leading to C3.

23.) C3 - Head north through the door, leading to B3.

24.) B3 - This is the final room before you battle the boss of this dungeon. 
This room is chock full of Goriya goodness. Stand far away from the pack if you 
have full hearts, and chuck sword beams at them to beat them from a safe 
distance. If you are lacking full power, you'll have to battle them in close 
quarters. Either way, they all have to be defeated. Defeat them all, gather 
what they drop, and some Bombs will appear in the corner of the room for you to 
take. Then, open the door at the north of the room, and enter into A3... the 
boss chamber.

25.) A3 - Dodongo's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - D O D O N G O

Dodongo is just as simple a boss battle as Aquamentus was in the first dungeon. 
He isn't vulnerable to any weapon in your arsenal, including your sword, so you 
should have taken a hint to his weakness, between the old man's hint in the 
dungeon, and the fact that the dungeon gives you bombs twice. As this 
rhinoceros boss walks towards you, drop a bomb in front of him. He will run 
into the bomb, "eating" it, and it'll blow up inside his mouth. You only have 
to do this twice to win. Dodongo has no attacks, he just walks around, 
frustrating you if you don't know how to beat him... but if you DO know how to 
beat him, he's cake baby... cake.

After Dodongo is defeated, go left, to room A2.

26.) A2 - In this room, grab the Triforce from the center of the room, and 
you'll be healed up and teleported out of the dungeon! Two down, seven to go!

Now that we've completed Dungeon Two, there's nothing for us to do before going 
right to Dungeon Three, so we'll do that right now. 

To get to Dungeon Three, leave Dungeon Two and work your way back to the 
origin, by going down from the Dungeon screen, then right one screen, then down 
'til you can't go down anymore, then right all the way to the coast (it's not 
far at all), then follow the coast down, and left until you get back to the 
origin. You should start knowing this region of Hyrule very well, so it 
shouldn't be hard for you to getback to the origin.

From the origin, go left once, then up one, and then left once, left again over 
the bridge and to the next screen, and left again past the old woman's cave 
whom sells magic potions. If you need the medicine she sells, now is the time 
to get it! If not, go left past that screen, and you'll enter the brown Lost 
Woods. Go immidiatly down one screen, and then make a sharp right. The dungeon 
is here, at coordinate H5. Enter the dungeon, and here we go!

This is where the dungeons start to get just a bit more complicated and 
lengthy, but they still shouldn't be considered "hard" yet. This dungeon is 
called the Manji dungeon... unfortunatly, I don't know if Nintendo is sensitive 
to this sort of thing in Japan as we are here in America and the rest of the 
world, but a Manji is the same shape as the Nazi Swastikaa... which is just 
plain wrong. But whatever, it's just a videogame. You shouldn't read into 
everything, right!? Then again, how can you not. The damn dungeon is just in a 
shape that offends everyone, including me. I'm just curious what they were 
thinking. But enough on that.

1.) F4 (entrance) - As you enter the dungeon, you'll notice that you can only 
go one way. So go that way, left, to F3.

2.) F3 - Here, you'll notice several large Gels, called Zols. They split up 
into Gels when you hit them with the Wooden Sword, but being that you have the 
White Sword equipped, they die with one hit and that's it. So kill them all, 
and whatever they drop, pick up. In the room when they all die is a key, which 
you should also pick up, before heading north to the next room, E3.

3.) E3 - In this room, there are more Zols for you to kill. The diagonal 
dividers here shouldn't prove to be too much trouble for you while fighting 
them, it just makes your fighting quarters a little tighter. When you kill all 
of the Zols, they drop a key. Grab it and head to D3, which is to the north.

4.) D3 - In this room, there are three Darknuts. Kill them if you can, or just 
avoid them. You can go north or west, but first, go west, to D2.

5.) D2 - In this here room, there is a Compass in the center. Be weary when you 
enter the room, however, as there are traps on all four corners of the room 
that'll shoot at you! Kill the various Keese in the room and grab the Compass. 
Use a key on the door at the left of the room, and enter into that room, which 
is __.

6.) D1 - In this room, there are a crap load of red knight enemies, called 
Darknuts. Darknuts walk around the room and don't attack, but are annoying to 
defeat, because they are only vulnerable in the back and side. If you slash at 
them when they're facing you, you'll hear a "clang" noise which means they 
blocked your attack with their shield. Kill all the Darknuts in this room and 
the door to the south will open up for you to go through. Go south through that 
door, to E1.

7.) E1 - In this room, there is a staircase to the right of the room. First, 
kill the plethora of Darknuts in this room, grabbing whatever they drop. They 
drop a crapload of Bombs if you need any, as well as Hearts and rupees. Grab 
what you can and then go down the stairs to the basement of that room. In the 
basement, go down the ladder and kill the four Keeses patrolling the basement 
if you like. Grab the Raft sitting there, and then go back upstairs. Leave the 
room going north, back to D1.

8.) D1 - Back here, simply shoot north across the room, to C1.

9.) C1 - Here, there are a crapload of enemies for you to contend with. Zols, 
Keese, and new enemies we've yet to encounter, called Bubbles, which are the 
glowing orbs shooting around the room. You can't damage them with your sword, 
so just avoid them, and kill the other enemies in the room. Grab the key in the 
room that they are all guarding as well. Then shoot right into the next room, 
which is room C2.

10.) C2 - In this room, it's a normal size place but you are stuck in a small 
corridor that only allows you to go horizontal across the room. That's okay 
though. Kill the Keese in the room, and Bombs will appear if you need them. 
Otherwise, go straight across and use a Key on the door to gain entrance to C3.

11.) C3 - This room holds many options for us. First and foremost, kill the 
three Zols to get them out of the way. Going south will lead us backwards, 
basically, so don't bother doing that. First go north and use the key on the 
door there to gain entrance to B3.

12.) B3 - In this room, be weary of the traps as you enter, otherwise they'll 
shoot down and damage you. Kill the two Zols in this room. The door to the 
north, the only way out of the room other than going back the way you came, is 
sealed shut. The left block of the two blocks in the center of the room should 
be pushed over, which will open the sealed door. Then go north through it, to 
A3.

13.) A3 - This is the Old Man's room of the dungeon. He'll ask you, "Did you 
get the sword from the Old Man on top of the waterfall?" Being that you did 
that in the beginning of the game (he's referring to the White Sword, of 
course), you can ignore him and go left, to A2.

14.) A2 - In this room, kill all of the Keese and grab the key they are 
guarding. It's that simple. Then we have to backtrack, so go back right to A3.

15.) A3 - Go south from here, back to B3.

16.) B3 - Go south again (be careful of the traps!), to room C3.

17.) C3 - Now that we're back in this room, go to the door at the right and use 
a key on it to open it. Then shoot through that door, to C4.

18.) C4 - In this room, again, be careful of the traps as you enter the room. 
Then, kill the two Zols in the center of the room and grab the Map there. Now, 
if you're not using the map that I made at the top of this section, you can 
know where you're going now! Now, you have some options. If you want to make a 
few rupees (it's not much, so I wouldn't bother), you can head south to D4. If 
not, bomb the right wall, and go through the hole you make in the wall, to C5, 
which is the bosses chamber.

19.) C5 - Manhandla's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - M A N H A N D L A

Manhandla looks pretty menacing, but trust me, he's not. You can beat Manhandla 
in a variety of ways. There is one really easy way (which could be considered 
cheap, I suppose) and another few ways to defeat him. The cheap way, and the 
way I most enjoy beating him, is simply placing a bomb in his path and beating 
him in one shot. While it's a difficult thing to destroy all four of his limbs 
with one bomb shot, if you place is strategically so that it'll blow up when he 
goes over it, it'll take him out in one shot, and one shot only, baby. If you 
want to attack him with your sword, you'll have to go limb-by-limb on him, 
which makes him tougher, because you'll have to continuously get in close to 
him to swipe. Eight hits with the Magic Sword will do him in (two hits will 
make one limb disappear, and so on and so forth). If you use the bomb technique 
on him, make sure you make it a good hit. Otherwise, you'll have to go back in 
with your sword or use another bomb to finish him off. It's a waste of time, 
energy, and items.

After Manhandla is defeated, go north to B5.

21.) B5 - Grab the Triforce in this room, and your energy will be refilled and 
you'll be transported outside of the dungeon. Three down, six to go!

Once outside of the dungeon, head back to the origin... it's straightforward. 
Just leave the dungeon area (which heads west), then shoot north one screen and 
east another to get out of the Lost Woods. You should know how to get back to 
the origin from there. Once back at the origin, we have some stuff to take care 
of before proceeding to dungeon four.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.) The Fourth Heart Container and the Monster Bait
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, now we can go get that fourth heart container. It's on the east coast of 
Hyrule, and very straight forward to get to. From the origin, simply head to 
the east all the way until you can't go anymore, to the coast. It's very 
simple, we've been down here before, you should know how to get there by now 
without having to have me explain it! Once you get all the way east, swing 
upwards one screen. Before you keep going up to the heart, go to the cave store 
there and buy Arrows if you haven't gotten any yet. Now we have a bow and 
arrow, how useful!

If you got Arrows already, all the better. Head north one screen, and you'll 
see a heart. However, we need the Stepladder to get that one, not the Raft, so 
keep going north! Go north two screens, and you'll come across an area where 
you can only go back down south, or west. There's a dock there however. Walk 
straight onto the dock and keep walking as if you were going across the water. 
The Raft will automatically shoot you across the water, to a secret cave, 
located at C16 on my map. Go in the cave, and get the heart from the old man 
there. Then leave this island, and head back to the dock on the mainland. Now 
to get the Monster Bait. We don't need it quite yet, but we should get it out 
of the way, since we can buy it in the area. Okay, so we're not in the area, 
but lets just get it now, and get it out of the way, okieday? =)

Once back at the dock on the mainland, head south, all the way back to the 
origin, the way we came. I don't have to retrace the steps, do I? Alright, 
good. Once back at the origin, head north, then west, all the way to the screen 
that holds the old woman's cave that sells the magic potions (G5). From there, 
head north two screens, to the cave there. Don't go in the cave, go up one more 
screen, to D5. Remember this place, where the secret store is that we bought 
the Blue Ring from earlier? Move the top, middle Armor (by touching him) and 
again, he'll reveal a hidden staircase. Go down the stairs and buy the Monster 
Bait from the storeclerk for 60 rupees. Now that we've done that, head back 
south, to the screen where the old woman selling medicine is, coordinate G5. 
From there, go east one screen and then cross the bridge. Head north after 
crossing the bridge, to the next screen. You see the dock there? Go north to 
the dock, and walk across it, and the Raft will take you across the water, to 
the island, which is where Dungeon Four is located! Enter the dungeon, and get 
ready to fight!

The fourth dungeon of the game doesn't hold too much difficulty and whatnot for 
the player, but, naturally, the difficulty level of each dungeon progresses as 
we get farther in the game, so it's naturally expected that this dungeon is 
slightly harder than the last dungeon we were at... and it is.

1.) H2 (entrance) -  In the first room of the dungeon, you can go either up, or 
you can go left. First, go to the room to your left, which is room H1.

2.) H1 - In this room, there is a swarm (if you can call it that) of Keeses. 
Kill each Keese in the room, and when they are all defeated, a key will appear 
in the middle of the room. Grab the key, and head back to the original room, 
H2.

3.) H2 - Back in this room, simply head north to G2.

4.) G2 - In this room, you'll encounter a new enemy - Vire. The Vires are large 
version of the Keese. When you slay a Vire, it mutates into two Keese, which 
are red in color instead of blue, and move slightly quicker. So in the room, 
kill the three Vires, as well as the smaller red Keese that spawn from their 
dead bodies, and then use the key on the door at the right side of the room. 
Enter into that door, going to room G3.

5.) G3 - As you enter the room, it'll be completly dark. So what do you do? Use 
the Blue Candle, of course! Use the Blue Candle and the room will automatically 
be lightened up, so that you can see what you're doing. This room is an 
annoying passageway, marked by numerous blocks. In relation to the enemies, 
there are quite a few Vires chillin' out in here. Kill them (use your Bow and 
Arrow to kill them from afar if you'd like, but be accurate with it when they 
turn into red Keeses!), and grab the Compass in the middle of the room that 
they were all guarding. Then head back through the door you came into, back to 
G2.

6.) G2 - Back here, just head north through the door, to F2.

7.) F2 - In this room, kill the plethora of Keeses, and grab the key they were 
all guarding. Then simply head left, to the next room, F1.

8.) F1 - In this room, again use the Blue Candle to light the room up, so you 
can see where you're going, and then kill all of the Vires chillin' in the 
room, hoping all over the damn place like they own it. =) Kill the red Keeses 
they split into when you hit them, and then simply go north to the door, 
leading into E1.

9.) E1 - Here in this room, it's more of the same. Firstly, light up the room 
with the Blue Candle, so you can see what you're doing. Because there are 
"rivers" in this screen (which can only be crossed with the Stepladder, which 
we get a bit later on in the dungeon), you have to walk around them to get 
around. Kill the easy Zol enemies in the room, and grab the key there. Then, go 
north to the door, leading to room D1.

10.) D1 - In this room, again use the Blue Candle to light it up. Then, be 
ready to fight. Avoid the Bubbles that are roaming around the room. If they hit 
you, as it was in the last dungeon, you won't be able to swing your sword for a 
few seconds, which obviously puts you at a huge disadvantage. Avoid or kill the 
Vires, and go to the door at the right. Enter into it, leading to D2.

11.) D2 - In this room, it's basically a winding passageway around the room. 
Patrolling the passageway is more of our friends, the Vires. Kill the Vires and 
the red Keeses they become, and the door to the right will open. Enter that 
door to the right, to room D3.

12.) D3 - This room has a new enemy in it as well, called Like Likes. Kill them 
(they take an amazing five hits to kill with the Magic Sword), but try to keep 
your distance. If they touch you, they'll eat your Magic Shield! And no, you 
won't get it back! That means you'll have to spend a crapload of rupees to buy 
another one, and you don't want to do that. So kill the two Like Likes in this 
room, as well as the two Zols, and avoid the two Bubbles floating around. There 
are two blocks in the middle of the room. Push over the leftmost one, and a 
staircase leading into the basement of the room will appear in the northeast 
corner of the room. Go down that staircase to the basement, and kill the Keeses 
there. Then, grab the Stepladder, and head back upstairs. Go back left, to the 
previous room, D2.

13.) D2 - Back in this room, you don't have to go around the passageway 
anymore... the Stepladder we just got allows you to avoid doing that and cross 
the rivers inside dungeons! So get to the door at the north of the room (ignore 
the Vires), and ignore the door locked up to the north. Instead, head back west 
again, to room D1.

14.) D1 - Once back here, you can now cross the river in the middle of the room 
that segments it into two halves. Cross over it, and use a key on the door in 
the north of the room, to gain access to the room above it, C1.

15.) C1 - In this room, kill all of the Vires if you want, or simply ignore and 
avoid them, and head to the door at the right hand side of the room, leading 
into the room we just ignored before, C2.

16.) C2 - This room can be accessed from the other place where I said ignore 
the locked door (in step 13). That's because we couldn't get across the water 
in the room to get to the map or passageway across from it. Kill the two Gels 
that are patrolling the passageway, and grab the Map from the other side of the 
room. Now, you want to know a little secret? Okieday. Go to the top of the 
screen and bomb the wall right in the middle. Enter the hole in the wall, to 
B2.

17.) B2 - This secret area is just kind of cool. Grab the rupees chillin' there 
waiting for ya. All four walls of the room are bombable. So bomb the wall on 
the lefthand side of the room, and enter through the hole you make to room B1.

18.) B1 - In this room, you'll fight the mini-boss (I guess you can call it 
that) of this dungeon, which is Manhandla, the boss we just fought in Dungeon 
Three. Use the same strategy on him you did on the original we fought. Use a 
bomb and blow him to pieces, and whatever part of him you miss, hack away with 
your sword, or use another bomb. Then simply head through the door at the north 
end of the room, to A1.

19.) A1 - This is the old man's chillin' place in this dungeon. He says to you 
here, "Walk into the waterfall." Hey thanks, Old Man River. =P Now, use a key 
on the door to the right of this room, and enter into the next room, A2.

20.) A2 - As you enter into this room, use your Blue Candle right away so you 
can see where you're going. Then, kill all of the Keese in the room and grab 
the key they are guarding. Shoot straight across the room to the door on the 
righthand side, leading to room A3.

21.) A3 - This room is darkened, but you don't really need to use the Blue 
Candle, but you can if you want. The only enemies in this room are traps, so be 
careful as you enter the room. Make your way to the door at the south side of 
the room, while avoiding the traps, and down into room B3.

22.) B3 - In this room, there are five Vires for you to fight. Kill the five 
Vires in the room, then oush the block at the left side of the room, and the 
door at the righthand side of the room will open for you. The room is B4, and 
it's the boss, Gleeok's, room.

23.) B4 - Gleeok's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - G L E E O K

Gleeok is definetly the hardest boss we've yet to fight in the game. While he 
doesn't move (like Aquamentus didn't), he shoots fireballs out of his various 
heads, and they are quite damaging when they hit Link. Not only that, but when 
you do enough damage to Gleeok, his head will split off of his body, and turn 
red. When it's flying around the room in this state, it will shoot fireballs at 
Link, making Gleeok an annoying version of Aquamentus, from a certain point of 
view. In anycase, you'll want to be well-healed before entering this battle. 
When you fight him, use your Sword Beams on him from far away if you have full 
health, while dodging the fireballs he shoots at you. If you aren't at full 
health, and don't have the advantage of using sword beams, then you'll simply 
have to get in close and hack the hell out of him. You'll be trading blows with 
him, but be consistant and he'll die long before you run out of health, for 
sure.

After Gleeok is defeated, go north to A4.

24.) A4 - In this room, grab the Triforce, and you'll be automatically healed 
and transported outside of the dungeon. 

Once outside of the dungeon, head back to the origin. You aren't far away from 
it at all, you should be able to get back to it on your own. Once back at the 
origin, it's time to take care of some stuff before we move on to dungeon five. 
So lets do that stuff now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.) The Final Heart Container and the Power Bracelet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once back at the origin, we can get the final heart container easily. As we've 
done many times now in the game, head all the way east from the origin until 
you can't go east anymore. Sound familiar? Of course it does. Then, go up two 
screens, and you'll see the heart on a dock in the middle of the water to your 
right. This is at coordinate Go up to the first dock, and use the Stepladder to 
get to it (it does it automatically, just walk towards it) and do it again to 
get to the dock which holds the final heart container we can get outside of a 
dungeon. That makes 12, which means we can get the Magical Sword, but first, 
lets get the Power Bracelet.

Head all the way back to the origin, being that the Power Bracelet is clear 
across Hyrule on the other side from where we are. Once back at the origin, go 
up and then left, to the screen where the cave is where the woman sells her 
magic potions. Now is actually a good time to buy potions from her if you need 
them, but other than that, head left one more screen. You're now in the Lost 
Woods. We've been here before, but now, we're going to traverse it. 

Once you enter the Lost Woods, go down. You'll be on a screen here that has 
three ways out of it other than the way we just came. Going right will lead us 
back to the third dungeon, so we don't want to go that way. The two paths 
leading left look more enticing. Of the two paths leading left, take the one on 
the bottom, and left into the next screen. Kill or avoid the various enemies 
you come across. None of them should give you any troubles at this point in the 
game. Follow the linear path heading left, and into the next screen. Then, head 
north, and you'll be back in the Lost Woods.

This part of the Lost Woods is a pain in the ass, because you have to do a 
certain sequence in it to get out of the woods. Famous Zelda players know it as 
ULDL, or Up, Left, Down, Left. That's how you get out of the Lost Woods. So do 
that now. Go up, then left, then down, then left. Don't worry, each screen is 
supposed to look the same... that's the idea. That's why it can be confusing. 
And doesn't the screen look like a backwards Norweigan flag, or Finnish flag, 
or Icelandic flag. How observant am I! =)

Anyway, you'll know you did the sequence right, because you'll hear the famous 
Zelda secret ring when you do it right. Then, just head up and out of the Lost 
Woods (for now, anyway). You'll be in the Hyrule Graveyard now. Lynels and 
other annoying (but beatable) enemies patrol these regions, so be careful when 
you fight. In this area, just go up the stairs one screen. Once in the 
graveyard proper, go right once, and then up once. If you come across a ghost 
enemy (called Ghinis), just ignore them. They don't move that fast, and are 
pretty strong enemies. It's not worth fighting them, to be honest.

Go right one more screen and you'll be outside of the graveyard now. Kill the 
Lynels and avoid the Peahats, and head right another screen. On this screen, 
there are two staircases heading up into the mountains. Ignore the one on the 
left, and take the one on the right. Once up the stairs, go right. There will 
be two rows of Armos enemies, all standing still. This is where the Power 
Bracelet is located. This is at coordinate C5 on my map. Awaken the Armor on 
the top row, the one all the way to the right, and underneath him will be the 
Power Bracelet. Pick it up, and then head back a few screens, back to the 
graveyard. We have one more thing to do here before we move on...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.) The Magical Sword
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Magical Sword is the next thing on our list to get. It's twice as powerful 
as the White Sword we have equipped now, making it four times stronger than the 
Wooden Sword. In otherwords, it's very, very strong. There are requirements to 
get it, however, which is why I waited until now to get it. You must have 12 
hearts in your reserves, which we have now. So, once back in the graveyard, 
simply go up one screen, and we'll be in the right place. There are 12 graves 
on each screen, correct? Go to the vertical row second to the right, and then 
the middle row horizontally. Push the grave there from the bottom upwards. A 
staircase will be hidden underneath of it. Go down the staircase, and grab the 
Magical Sword from the old man! WOOHAH! Now THAT'S the ticket, baby. (note: The 
Magic Sword, on my map, is at coordinate C2.)

Anyway, once you get the Magical Sword (oh the power!), head all the way back 
to the origin. Once you're back there, we can head to the next dungeon, dungeon 
five. To get there from the origin, go right one screen, then up all the way 
until you can't go up anymore. From there, go left, then up, then left again, 
and you'll be near Death Mountain, where all of the rocks fall on you and 
whatnot. Go right many a screen until you notice that the screen is repeating 
itself. Go up the stairs into Death Mountain, and go up the stairs four times 
(the screen'll look the same, but it's not), and you'll hear the famous Zelda 
secret tone. Enter Dungeon five, and get ready for some fun. Or not.

The fifth dungeon can be a bit annoying, and is harder than any dungeon we've 
yet to face in the game as of now, but that's perfectly natural. The cool thing 
about this dungeon is that you can buy a Bomb Capacity Addition, which allows 
you to carry 12 Bombs instead of just 8. It costs 100 rupees, and is within the 
confines of the dungeon, so make sure to follow my walkthrough to a tee so you 
don't miss it!

1.) H3 (Entrance) - As you enter the dungeon, head right, to the next room, 
room H4.

2.) H4 - In this room, there are new enemies for you to face, hoping around 
like crazy. They are called Pols Voice, and they are surprisingly strong. With 
the Blue Ring equipped, they still take away one whole heart each time they 
touch you. And with the Magical Sword, they can take two hits before perishing! 
The Bow and Arrow works nicely on them, but it's really not worth using it... 
just use the Magical Sword, and conserve your rupees [arrows], 'cause you'll 
need them to make a purchase later in the dungeon. When you defeat all of the 
Pols Voices, grab the key that appears in the middle of the room, then walk up 
to the top wall and bomb the middle of it. Go through the hole you blow through 
the wall, to G4.

3.) G4 - This is the room where the Old Man of the dungeon resides. He tells 
you, "Digdogger hates certain kind of sound." Thanks for the proper English, 
old man! =D Anyway, when you do that, you'll notice that there is a locked door 
to the left of the old man. Ignore it, to save a key. Instead, go back south 
through the hole in the wall, back to room H4.

4.) H4 - Back in this room, backtrack to the left, back to the entrance, H3.

5.) H3 - Back here in the entrance, shoot up north, to G3.

6.) G3 - As you walk into this room, use the Blue Candle right away to light up 
this darkened room. New enemies reside in this room as well. These mummy-like 
foes are called Gibdos, and are pretty basic enemies. They don't attack, but 
they can take a lot of damage, even with the Magical Sword equipped on Link. In 
anycase, kill the three Gibdos chillin' in the room, and one of them will drop 
a key, which you should pick up. Ignore the door to the right of the room, 
which is locked! It leads back to the Old Man's room we just bombed into 
earlier, so I saved you a key! Instead, walk to the wall on the west of the 
room, and plant a bomb in the middle of it. Blow a hole through the wall, and 
then walk through it, to room G2.

7.) G2 - In this room, there are more Gibdos for you to do battle with. Keep in 
mind that one of them will drop some Bombs for you, so make sure to grab them, 
you'll need to restock them. When they are all defeated, you'll notice that the 
sealed door above doesn't budge, and that the four blocks in the room aren't 
triggers for it. Henceforth, you'll have to bomb your way through the left wall 
again! Place a bomb in the middle of the left wall, and, again, walk through 
the hole you create, to G1.

8.) G1 - In this room, there are a few blue Darknuts to deal with, which are 
harder than their red cousins, but still only take two hits with the Magical 
Sword to subdue. Remember, that like the red Darknuts, the blue Darknuts are 
also not vulnerable to hits from the front, as they block them with their 
shield. So you have to hit them from the side or back! And they twist and turn 
in their paths a lot, so be careful. In anycase, when they are all dead, pick 
up whatever they drop, and push the leftmost block of the blocks blocking the 
way to the staircase in the room, and go down the stairs. Kill the Keese in 
this basement here, and go up the ladder on the other side, to a new area of 
the dungeon, room A3.

9.) A3 - In this room, come out of the stairs and you'll notice two doors out 
of this room, both of which are locked. Which one do we go to? First, open the 
door on the left, and enter into room A2.

10.) A2 - In this room, there's a crapload of blue Darknuts for you to fight. 
Kill them all, and then push the block in the middle of the room upwards. A 
staircase will appear in the corner of the room, which you should use to get 
into the basement. In the basement, kill the Keese, and grab the Whistle there! 
This is the item of this dungeon! So now that we've found that, go back 
upstairs, and then back to your right, back into room A3.

11.) A3 - Once back in the original staircase room we just "warped" too, use 
the key on the door to the south of the room, and go through it, to room B3.

12.) B3 - In this room, there are a bunch of weak Keeses for you to deal with. 
Do away with all of them, and grab the key that they were guarding. It seems 
like this room is a dead end, but it's not. Use a bomb in the middle of the 
righthand wall, and enter through the hole there into B4.

13.) B4 - In this room, an old man is selling a Bomb Upgrade for 100 rupees, 
which allows you to hold up to 12 Bombs instead of just 8. If you don't have 
the amount of rupees you need, you gotta leave the dungeon (or fight within the 
dungeon) and get enough rupees so you can do your thing or whatever. When you 
do get the Bomb Upgrade, head back to room B3.

14.) B3 - Back here, just go north to room A3.

15.) A3 - Once back in this room, take the staircase back down into the 
basement, and come up on the other side, at room G1.

16.) G1 - From here, ignore all of the blue Darknut enemies, and shoot to the 
right of the room, back through the hole in the wall we busted open with a bomb 
earlier, and back into room G2.

17.) G2 - Back in this room, re-kill all of the Gibdos. You'll notice that even 
after you kill all of them, that the door to the north of the room is still 
closed. The four blocks in the room, surprisingly, are not the key either, so 
simply ignore this room, and go right, into another room we've already been in, 
room G3.

18.) G3 - In this room, kill the three Gibdos running around, and the shut door 
to the north of the room will open, revealing a passage into room F3, which you 
should take.

19.) F3 - Once in here, you'll be in a desert-like room, with three Dodongos! 
Fear not, however... they are easier now that we're stronger, than they were 
when we had to fight them as boss enemies in the second dungeon. Do you 
remember how to kill them? If not, simply place bombs in front of where they're 
walking so they'll walk into them, and eat them. The bombs will explode in 
their mouths and injure them. Two bombs per Dodongo will do them in. So kill 
the three Dodongos, and when they are dead, gather the Bombs that appear in the 
middle of the room as a reward. As a side award, the door to the left of the 
room will open for you. Go through this now opened door, to room F2.

20.) F2 - In this room, simply kill all of the Zols that are in the room, and a 
key will appear in the middle of the room. Grab the key, and ignore the door 
leading south (it leads back to the room that north door won't open, so it's a 
trap, meaning you'll have to backtrack if you go down there), and then go back 
the way you came, through the right door, to F3.

21.) F3 - Back in this Dodongo room (void of the Dodongos, of course), head 
north through the door (using a key on it to open it), to room E3.

22.) E3 - In this room, use the Blue Candle to light it up for you to see if 
you'd like, and grab the Map. Being that the room has a huge moat in the middle 
of it, you can't go anywhere in this room except back to the previous room, so 
go south, back to room F3.

23.) F3 - Back here, since we've taken care of the other doors in the room, go 
right, to room F4.

24.) F4 - Right away, use the Blue Candle to light up the room. Then kill all 
of the Zols in the room, and some rupees will appear in the middle of the room 
for you (not much of a reward, I know). Then shoot through the north door, to 
room E4.

25.) E4 - In this room, there are a bunch of Gibdos for you to kill. Slay them 
all, and they'll drop a key for you to take. Grab the key, and ignore the door 
leading left (it leads to the same room you got the Map in prior, but it leads 
nowhere, really). Instead, go through the north door, to room D4.

26.) D4 - In this darkened room, there are nothing but some red Darknuts for 
you to contend with. With your Magical Sword, they only take on hit now, so 
they are chumps. Just aim for their sides and backs to do damage! (as always!). 
When they are all defeated, grab the Compass they drop, then shoot north one 
more time to room C4. (it's your option in this room to use the Blue Candle, 
being that it's dark... but you don't really need to).

27.) C4 - This room is chock full of monster goodness, indeed. Right away, use 
the Blue Candle to light things up. There are two Gibdos, two Pols Voices, and 
two Keeses in this room. Grab the key in the middle of the room as you melee 
with the enemies in the room. When they are all defeated, and you nabbed the 
key, use it on the door to the left of the room, and enter into room C3.

28.) C3 - In this simple room, there are five Gibdos for you to end the lives 
of. When you kill all five of them, a key will appear, which you should take 
and enter into the next room to your left, to room C2.

29.) C2 - In this room, you can hear the cries of the boss! We are close! Kill 
all of the Pols Voices in the room and then use a key on the door to the left, 
to enter into the boss lair of Digdogger, room C1.

30.) C1 - Digdogger's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - D I G D O G G E R

Digdogger might be a hard boss, if you don't know how to defeat him the proper 
way, that is. As you enter the battle, equip the Whistle we found within 
Dungeon Five (also called the Recorder, if you're a nerd), and blow the Whistle 
to hear a pretty tune. Not only is this tune pretty, but it is deadly to the 
Digdogger! It'll reduce his size to practically nothing! Once you do this to 
Digdogger, simply run up to him and give him two slashes with your sword, and 
he'll die (granted you have the Magical Sword, otherwise it'll take more 
slashes). He doesn't have any attacks in the small form... you'll simply have 
to worry more about getting hit and damaged by the four statues that shoot 
fireballs at you in each corner of the room. You should be done with Digdogger 
in a matter of five seconds though, so getting hit once or twice shouldn't 
matter at all... and you can always block those fireballs with your shield! In 
anycase, take the bastard down.

After Digdogger is defeated, go north to B1.

31.) B1 - In this room, grab the Triforce, and you'll be automatically healed 
and transported outside of the dungeon. 

Once outside of the dungeon, head back to the origin, as we usually do after we 
finish off a dungeon. Then just regroup, and we'll go right to the sixth 
dungeon!

To get to the sixth dungeon from the origin, this is what we do. Go right one 
screen, and then up all the way until you can go up no longer. Then go left a 
screen, then up a screen, then left a screen once more (crossing the river via 
the Stepladder, in case you think my directions are wrong). Go left one more 
screen, and there'll be two staircases heading south. Take either of these 
staircases, and once down them, go left one screen. In this screen, ignore the 
stairs going north, and go left once more. Then, go south down the stairs, and 
then west, and then north up the stairs (killing or avoiding the mighty Lynels 
as you go), to get to the sixth dungeon! It's showtime!

The sixth dungeon, in the words of my Uncle John, gets a little bit "hairy"... 
and take his word for it, 'cause he never lies. Ah yes, but really... the shear 
volume of enemies found within the confines of the dungeon is enough to make 
any Zelda nerd shiver and yell "Hookshot!" I don't even know what the hell I'm 
talking about anymore... onward.

1.) H2 (Entrance) - Once here in the entrance, head right, through the open the 
door, to room H3.

2.) H3 - In this room, use the Blue Candle right away, so that you can see 
where you're going. This is your first encounter with the biggest pain-in-the-
ass enemies in the game; Wizzrobes. These mystical enemies come in two 
varieties. These are the weaker of the two, as they are red in color. They 
shoot magical beams out of their hands, and can disappear and reappear anywhere 
on screen. With your Magical Sword, one swipe at them kills these red 
Wizzrobes, but be careful to block or avoid their magic, as it does some crazy 
damage to Link. Once they are all defeated (there are five of them in this 
room), grab the key they drop, and go north through the door, unlocking it with 
the key you just got, to room G3.

3.) G3 - In this room, the old man speaks to you, telling you, "Aim at the eyes 
of Gohma." Gohma is the boss in this dungeon, just so you know... and you'll 
see what the old man is talking about when we go fight Gohma. But for now, go 
back down, to room H3.

4.) H3 - Back in this room, just go left, back to the entrance, room H2.

5.) H2 - This time, use a key on the door to your left, and enter into room H1.

6.) H1 - In this room, there are three more Wizzrobes for you to combat. Kill 
them, avoiding their powerful magical energy, and grab whatever they drop 
(hopefully hearts, if they've hit you a few times). Then just go north, to room 
G1, the next room in our path.

7.) G1 - In this room, thankfully, there are only Zols for you to slay. Slay 
these poor, helpless enemies, and a Compass will appear in the room! Grab the 
Compass, and continue going north through the dungeon, to room F1.

8.) F1 - Here in this room of the dungeon, there are a crapload of Keeses for 
you to kill. Kill the Keeses while avoiding the fireballs from the statues in 
the room, or blocking them with your Magic Shield. Either way, when all of the 
Keeses are defeated, a key will appear in the middle of the room, and the 
sealed door to the north of the room will also open. Shoot north, to the next 
room, room E1.

9.) E1 - In this room, simply run north quickly, avoiding the traps flying 
towards you around the room, going north, to room D1.

10.) D1 - This room is ridiculous... well,that's all I can really say about it. 
There are eight enemies in this room... two of each variety of Wizzrobe, two 
Bubbles (that hinder you from using your sword for a few seconds if they touch 
you), and two Like Likes, that can steal your Magic Shield if they touch you. 
To say the least, this room is a little bit on the crazy side. In anycase, kill 
all of the enemies (except for the Bubbles, who can't be killed). When the room 
is void, push the block at the left of the room over, to open the north sealed 
door. Go north through it, to room C1.

11.) C1 - This room has more Wizzrobes for you to compete with. Kill all of the 
Wizzrobes, and hope that they drop some hearts for you to use. Make sure to 
keep an eye on your heart containers... I'm telling you, these Wizzrobes can 
really destroy you before you even know what hit you. When they are all 
defeated, you can go north, but there is a Gleeok up there. To avoid it, bomb 
the righthand wall right in the middle, and go through the hole we make in the 
wall there, to room C2.

12.) C2 - In this room, there are more Wizzrobes. *sigh* In anycase, use the 
Blue Candle to light up the darkened room, and kill the Wizzrobes. It's an 
option to grab the key in the center of the room and not kill any of them... 
but they'll be here when you return to this room, so do it now, or do it 
later... or don't do it at all, I don't care. =) Grab the key at the center of 
the room, and use it on the door to the north, heading to room B2.

13.) B2 - In this room, there are two Zols, two Bubbles, and two Like Likes. 
Kill the two Like Likes and the two Zols, and a Map will appear in the room. 
Grab the Map, and then go through the door to the north of the room (the one 
that's locked), using a key on it to open it. Enter into room A2.

14.) A2 - In this room, there is a slew more of Wizzrobes. Work fast, killing 
them and playing a defensive game with your shield and your agility, so that 
you don't take too much damage from these mighty foes. When all of the 
Wizzrobes are defeated in the room, push over the left block in the room, to 
make a staircase appear it the upper righthand corner of the room. Take the 
staircase down into the room's basement, and kill the Keese down there. Grab 
the Magic Wand, and then go back up the stairs. Head back down to the previous 
room, room B2.

15.) B2 - Once back in this room, cross over the red river, and through the 
door at the right of the room, to room B3.

16.) B3 - In this room, there are five of the weaker variety of Wizzrobes, and 
a key in the middle of the room. Kill the Wizzrobes, and grab the key they were 
all guarding. You have an option to go north, or to go west. Go north through 
the door, to the next room up north, room A3.

17.) A3 - In this room, there are two Zols, two Like Likes, and two Bubbles... 
a combonation of enemies that we've seen before. Kill the two Like Likes and 
the two Zols, and then bomb the middle of the righthand side wall, to make a 
passage into room A4, which you should take.

18.) A4 - In this room is another old man, who tells you, "There are secrets 
where fairies don't live." Wow, that's great. =P Heh heh... now, go back left, 
through the bombed wall, to room A3. (ignore the door leading south... there 
are a crapload of enemies down there, that'd be in your best interest to 
ignore).

19.) A3 - Back in this room, go south, to room B3.

20.) B3 - Once back here, go west, back to room B2.

21.) B2 - Now that we're back here, go south, back to room C2.

22.) Back in this room, kill any Wizzrobes you may have left behind (I told you 
to kill them the first time we were here!), and then go south once more, to a 
new room, room D2.

23.) D2 - This room holds some enemies we haven't seen in a while... Vires. 
Light up the room with the Blue Candle and slay the weak Vires with your mighty 
Magical Sword. Grab whatever goodies they drop, and go right, to room D3.

24.) D3 - This room is full of enemies, as well, making it just as big of a 
pain in the ass as three other rooms in this damn dungeon. =) Kill all of the 
Wizzrobes and Like Likes, leaving just the Bubble in the room. Use Magic 
Potions if you're running out of energy! When only the Bubble remains, push the 
block in the middle of the room to the left, and a staircase will appear. Take 
the staircase into the basement, and re-emerge on the other side, in room B6.

25.) B6 - As you re-emerge in this room, more enemies are there to greet you; 
Zols and Like Likes. Kill them or avoid them, and go down, into room C6. We're 
almost there, I promise!

26.) C6 - In this darkened room, use the Blue Candle, and then kill the three 
Vires, and a key will appear. While avoiding the Bubbles, grab the key, and go 
left, into the next room, room C5.

27.) C5 - This room has so many enemies for you to fight, it's not even funny. 
So don't even bother with any of them. Ignore the door to the south, it leads 
no where important. Instead, run straight up to the door at the north end of 
the room, unlock it, and go through the door, entering into Gohma's boss 
lair... whew. Now we just gotta fight the boss! This is room B5.

28.) B5 - Gohma's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - G O H M A

Gohma is a crab-looking enemy, who is easily defeated, so don't worry. Remember 
the first or two Old Men in this dungeon, the one who told you to shoot at the 
eye of Gohma? Well that's the key. Equip the Bow and Arrow. When Gohma opens 
his eye during battle, shoot an arrow at his eye, and he'll die just like that. 
Gohma doesn't open his eye often during battle, however, and runs back and 
forth at the top of his lair shooting numerous fireballs at Link. So be careful 
when you fight him! Block the fireballs with your Magic Shield, or avoid them 
all together, and wait for that time when he opens that eye of his. Then, just 
shoot that arrow at his eye, and he'll crumble, leaving nothing but a heart for 
you, Link, to get. He's easy, ain't he. =) But imagine if you didn't know what 
to do against him... ALWAYS LISTEN TO OLD MEN! That's what that lesson teaches 
you, young one. =)

After Gohma is defeated, go north to room A5.

29.) A5 - In this room, grab the Triforce, and you'll be automatically healed 

and transported outside of the dungeon. 

Dungeon Seven is the next dungeon on our trip, but before we head to that 
dungeon, make sure you bought Monster Bait earlier in the game, and if you 
haven't done so yet, do so now. I buy it very early in the game so I don't have 
to do it later, but if you haven't bought it yet, we need it for the seventh 
dungeon, so purchase it at one of many stores around Hyrule. (see the map above 
the walkthrough section for exact coordinates)

Head back to the origin once you're all prepared (Monster Bait, don't forget), 
and from there, head north one screen, and then left all the way into the Lost 
Woods region. Once surrounded by brown trees, head north one screen, and then 
left (along either path) to the next screen. Then go around and head north, and 
you'll be in a dead end region of Hyrule, with a pond in the middle of the 
screen. Worry not... you're not lost. Play the Whistle, and the pond will dry 
up, revealing a staircase. Decend the staircase, and welcome to Dungeon Seven, 
The Demon!

Dungeon Seven, "The Demon," isn't too difficult of a dungeon to defeat, 
especially after we got through the hell that is dungeon six, and we got out 
alive, to boot. =) The dungeon is pretty big, but pretty smushed together. You 
shouldn't get too lost... plus, the boss is Aquamentus... the boss from the 
first dungeon, so... ha ha ha, don't laugh!

1.) H2 (entrance) - Once you enter this dungeon, you can go north, or you can 
go east. Ignore the door to the north, and head east, into room H3.

2.) H3 - In this room, there are two Moldorms for you to attack. Kill both of 
them, and some Bombs will appear in the room, if you need any. Once done in 
there, head north, to room G3.

3.) G3 - Here in this room, use the Blue Candle right away so you can see what 
you're doing in this darkened room, and you'll see a bunch of Keeses on the 
attack. Kill them all, and manuver around the huge box in the middle of the 
room, giving the Keeses the advantage. When they are all defeated, ignore the 
door heading left (no reason to go there), and head right, to room G4.

4.) G4 - This room is chock full of boomerang chucking Goriyas for you to 
fight. Kill all of them, and then head through the door at the right of the 
room, to room G5.

5.) G5 - In this room, there is a Digdogger. Just ignore it, don't bother 
fighting him. He's easy (especially with the Whistle), but it's a waste of 
time. Just go around him, to the door at the right of the room, which leads 
into room G6.

6.) G6 - In this room, there are some weak Stalfos enemies walking around. One 
of them is carrying a key. Slay all of these weak enemies, and grab the Key 
which one of them drops. Then head left, back to the room where the Digdogger 
is, room G5.

7.) G5 - Just avoid the Digdogger again as you head to your left, back to room 
G4.

8.) G4 - Back in this room, take the north door, to room F4.

9.) F4 - In this room, there is an old man. Listen to the old man's wise words; 
"There's a secret in the tip of the nose." Yeah, whatever. =P Anywho, after you 
talk to him, you can go back south, back to room G4.

10.) G4 - Back here, just swing back west, to room G3.

11.) G3 - Use the Blue Candle in this room again, then take the outside of the 
room around the box to the north wall. Bomb the middle of the north wall to 
create a hole in the wall, and go north through it, to room G3.

12.) F3 - This room needs to be lit up with the Blue Candle, so do that first. 
Then, kill all the weak little Stalfos running around. When all of them are 
defeated, a Compass will appear. Grab the Compass, then head through the left 
door, to room F2.

13.) F2 - This room has a bunch of Goriyas, of both varieties, for you to kill. 
Slay them all, and then go through the left door, to room F1.

14.) F1 - In this room, there are three Dodongos waiting to take you on. Just 
biomb the hell out of 'em. You can bomb them so they eat them (which takes two 
bombs per Dodongo), or bomb them so it freezes them, and then hack at them with 
your sword. Either or, it doesn't matter to me. =) When they are all defeated, 
use a key on the north door, entering into room E1.

15.) E1 - In this room, an old man will sell you the second of two bomb 
capacity upgrades found in the game. Give him 100 rupees and he'll give you 16 
Bombs maximum, which is a good deal, 'cause trust me, you'll need them later. 
If you don't have 100 rupees, go fight Stalfos and Goriyas back around the 
beginning of the dungeon until you do. After you buy the upgrade, go back south 
into the Dodongo room, room F1.

16.) F1 - Back in the Dodongo room, head south, to room G1.

17.) G1 - In this room, be weary of the traps by both doors. Kill the Keese in 
the room to get them to drop some Bombs when they are all dead, and then head 
south again, to room H1.

18.) H1 - In this room, avoid the fireballs shot by the two statues in the 
room, and grab the Key, while killing or avoiding the Ropes in the room. After 
you nab the key, head back north, to room G1.

19.) G1 - Avoid the traps once more in this room, as you head north to room F1.

20.) F1 - Back in the Dodongo room once more, head east, back to room F2.

21.) F2 - Once you're back in this room, just head north, through the door 
there, to room E2.

22.) E2 - In this room, there are a plethora of enemies, including Bubbles, 
Keese, and Goriyas. Kill the Goriyas and Keese while avoiding the Bubbles (as 
you can't kill them, as you should know by now). When the other enemies are 
defeated in the room, the door to the north will be open for you to go through. 
Go through that door now, to room D2.

23.) D2 - In this room, kill or ignore the Digdogger. While avoiding all of the 
fireballs from the statues in the room, go to the righthand wall and bomb the 
middle of it to make a hole. Then, go through the hole into room D3.

24.) D3 - Here, you'll encounter two more Moldorms. Kill both of them and a key 
will appear. Grab the key, and simply head back west, to the room previous 
where we fought/avoided the Digdogger, room D2.

25.) D2 - Go left through this room now, to the door there, to room D1.

26.) D1 - As you enter this room, the door behind you will shut, so you'll be 
forced to fight the enemies within, which are basically numerous Goriyas. Kill 
them all, then use a key on the door to the north, and enter through that door, 
to room C1.

27.) C1 - This room is where we need the Monster Bait, so if for some retarded 
reason you didn't get it before coming here like I told you to, you need to 
leave the dungeon and get it. The monster will say "grumble grumble" but don't 
be afraid of his harsh words! Go up to him and use the Monster Bait on him, and 
he'll disappear, leaving the passage going north open, so go north, to room B1.

28.) B1 - Once in this room, use the Blue Candle so you can see. Kill all the 
Goriyas and Keeses in the room, and avoid those pesky Bubbles (I wish we can 
kill those bastards sometimes!) Then go to the middle of the north wall, and 
bomb through it, to get to a secret room. Go through the hole to room A1.

29.) A1 - In this room, just grab the numerous coinage, and then go back south, 
to room B1.

30.) B1 - Back here, just go to room B2, which is to the east through the door, 
just unlock it with a key.

31.) B2 - In this room, there are many a Goriya. Kill them all, and then shoot 
through the door at the north of the room, to room A2.

32.) A2 - In this room, there are more Goriyas, of both colors, for you to 
slay. Slay them all and gather whatever they drop, including the 5 rupee piece 
reward for killing them all. Then go through the door at the east of the room, 
which leads to A3.

33.) A3 - There are Goriyas and Statues in this room, but you don't necessarily 
have to fight any of them. Just get the key in the middle of the room that they 
are all guarding, and then go back through the door at the left of the room 
that you came in through, back to room A2.

34.) A2 - Go south, back to room B2.

35.) B2 - Once back here, go to the righthand wall, in the middle of it, and 
bomb it, then go through the hole you made in the wall, to room B3.

36.) B3 - In this room, kill all the Goriyas while avoiding their boomerangs 
and such. When they are all defeated, push the block on the lefthand side up, 
and enter into the staircase, which will lead to the basement of the room. Grab 
the Red Candle there while avoiding or killing the Keese, then resurface into 
the room. Go to the righthand side of the room, to the middle of the wall, and 
bomb through that wall as well, which will lead you to room B4.

37.) B4 - In this here room, there are a bunch of Goriyas and two locked doors. 
Kill all the Goriyas, and ignore the door leading north, instead unlocking the 
door leading to the east, which you should go through, to room B5.

38.) B5 - In this room, there are four statues shooting fireballs at you, and 
you'll have to fight a Digdogger as well. Just toot your Whistle, then destroy 
the three small Digdoggers with two hacks of your Magical Sword each. Then just 
go north, through the door to room A5.

39.) A5 - In this room, two statues take up the middle of the room (shooting 
fireballs, naturally) while you'll have to fight and kill three Dodongos. Break 
out your bombs, and then use the same strategy that you did earlier. When they 
are defeated, bomb the middle of the righthand wall, and enter through the hole 
you've made there, to room A6.

40.) A6 - This room is really pretty difficult. This is the first time in the 
game you actually have to kill the Wall Masters, which is a tricky proposition. 
All the while, you have to avoid those Bubbles, because if they hit you, you'll 
be unable to unsheath your sword for a few seconds, making you bait for the 
Wall Masters. Thankfully, the Wall Masters only take one hit each to defeat 
with the Magical Sword, so that's always good. There are five total, so defeat 
them all, and don't let them touch you, or back to the entrance of the dungeon 
you will find yourself! When they are all slain, push the middle block on the 
blocks going vertical across the room, and a staircase will appear in the 
corner of the room. Go down those stairs, to reappear on another side of the 
dungeon, room C2.

41.) C2 - When you resurface, you'll be in a room chock full of Goriya 
goodness. Kill all of the blue and red Goriyas, so the room is empty of any 
foes. When you're set, bomb the righthand wall in the middle, and enter into 
that room, to fight the boss, room C3.

42.) C3 - Aquamentus' Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - A Q U A M E N T U S

Well, we get to fight Aquamentus again, go figure. For those of you whom are 
dense (^_^), Aquamentus is the very first boss we fought in the game. Why they 
stuck him in the seventh dungeon is well beyond me, but go figure. He's the 
same exact dude we fought earlier on, but if you want to have some fun, equip 
the Bow and Arrow and shoot him in the head three times to subdue him. He's not 
treacherous anymore, so there's not much more I can say about him... just slay 
the begger! When he's defeated, just grab that heart piece and thank your lucky 
stars it was that easy to get. Wait 'til you fight Ganon. =)

After Aquamentus is defeated, go east to room C4.

43.) C4 - In this room, grab the Triforce, and you'll be automatically healed 
and transported outside of the dungeon. 

Once outside of the dungeon, we're ready to go right to the eighth dungeon, 
which is the final dungeon before Death Mountain! You stoked!? 'Cause you 
should be. =) Head all the way back to the origin, and make sure you're 15 
heart containers are full, as well as making sure you have red potion in your 
inventory. You can never be too safe.

From the origin, head right all the way a few screens until you hit water. This 
is the screen where we got a heart piece very early in the game. From here, 
head north two screens, and then go east along the top of the two paths. Head 
east, and then go south. Equip the Red Candle and burn the lone bush in the 
middle of the screen, the one that sticks out from the two groups of bushes, 
towards the righthand side of the screen. Enter the staircase that's under the 
bush there, and welcome yourself to the eighth dungeon!

Dungeon eight is small and straightforward, thankfull enough, because after we 
conquer this dungeon, off to Death Mountain we go... and that dungeon is 
anything but small and straightforward. In anycase, the boss enemy is a boss 
we've already fought before, just like Aquamentus' return in the last dungeon. 
In this dungeon, we fight Gleeok... harder than Aquamentus, but still 
elementary, my dear. =)

1.) H4 (entrance) - From the entrance, head right through the door, to room H5.

2.) H5 - In this darkened room, use the Red Candle to light it up, and then 
kill the Zols and other enemies in there, avoiding the Bubbles as you go. In 
the middle of the room is a Key, which you should grab, and then exit out of 
the room, back to the entrance, to room H4.

3.) H4 - Once back in the entrance, take the door to the left, to room H3.

4.) H3 - In this room, two statues shoot fireballs at you from the center of 
the room while a Manhandla runs around causing havoc. You have to defeat the 
Manhandla to get the door to the left to open, so kill him, using your Magical 
Sword, or Bombs, whichever you want. He's easy now, he just gets faster as you 
cut off his limbs, but he was like that every time we've fought him, so this 
should be nothing new for you. When he's defeated, get the five rupees as your 
reward in between the two statues (avoid or block their fireballs), and go 
through the door at the left of the room, into room H2.

5.) H2 - In this room, there are Darknuts, Gibdos and Bubbles for you to 
contend with. Avoid the Bubbles and slay the Darknuts. They aren't so annoying 
anymore, just make sure to hit them in the back or sides, or otherwise you 
won't damage them, as you know by now. The Gibdos are elementary to defeat as 
well, so fear not. When they are all defeated, push the block at the left of 
the staircase in the middle of the room to gain access to it. Go down the 
stairs into the basement of the room, where there are Keeses and a Magic Book. 
Grab the Magic Book, avoid or kill the Keeses, and go back to the main floor. 
Then leave this room the way you came in, to the door at the right, to room H3.

6.) H3 - Shoot across this room, while avoiding the fireballs from the statues, 
back to the entrance of the dungeon, room H4.

7.) H4 - Once back at the entrance again, go north through the door there, to 
room G4.

8.) G4 - In this room, there is another Manhandla for you to battle. Do 
whatever you want to it, just kill it. =) Grab the five rupees he drops, and 
then bomb the middle of the northern wall to make an exit out of this room, and 
go through the hole to room F4.

9.) F4 - In this room, there are Statues and blue Darknuts galore. Ignore them 
for now, and unlock the door to the right of the room, and enter into that 
room, which is room F5.

10.) F5 - Light up this darkened room with the Red Candle, and then slay all of 
the hoping and jumping Pols Voices. Grab the Compass that they guard, and head 
back to the previous room, room F4.

11.) F4 - Back here, kill all of the blue Darknuts in this room. When they are 
all defeated, the rooms to the north and the west become available, and they 
also drop a key. Grab the key, and go through the western door, to room F3.

12.) F3 - In this room, light it up with a Red Candle, and then slay all of the 
beasties in here, including the Pols Voices and whatever else, to get the key 
they drop when they are all defeated. Then simply head left into the next room, 
which is room F2.

13.) F2 - In this room, there are four statues trying to hit you with their 
fireballs, and three red Darknuts, the weaker variety of Darknut. Avoid the 
fireballs and slay the Darknuts, and they'll drop a key. Grab the key, and head 
back to the right, to room F3.

14.) F3 - Once back in this room, light it up with a Red Candle once more, and 
then take the northern door, to room E3.

15.) E3 - In this room is a Gohma, like we've fought in the past, but this one 
is blue, and takes three hits with your Bow and Arrow to fell. Be patient with 
him, it takes a little while, as he is only vulnerable when his eye is open, 
and he opens it rarely and for short bursts. Block whatever fireballs (or avoid 
them) that he shoots at you while you're waiting for that eye to open, and when 
it opens, pummel him. When he's defeated, go north through the door in that 
room, to room D3.

16.) D3 - This is the old man room. Heh heh. He says, "Spectacle Rock is an 
entrance to death." He's basically telling you that Death Mountain is where the 
last dungeon is. Just so you know. =) Leave that room back to the south, back 
to room E3.

17.) E3 - Back in the Gohma room, just head right, unlocking the door with a 
key, to the next room, room E4.

18.) E4 - In this room, there are Gibdos and Darknuts for you to slay, as well 
as two Bubbles for you to avoid at all costs! =) When they are defeated, 
they'll drop five rupees, which you can get if you want. After that, ignore the 
door leading south (leads to a room we've been to already), and unlock the door 
to the north, and go to room D4.

19.) D4 - As you enter into this room, two statues and six blue Darknuts are 
there to greet you. Kill them all and avoid those fireballs best you can, 
although you're more likely than not to take a beating in this room, it's 
pretty tough. When those Darknuts are defeated, the door to the right opens, 
but ignore it for now. Go north by bombing a wall in the middle of the north 
wall instead, to room C4.

20.) C4 - In this room, you'll meet yet another Manhandla. Kill him, and he'll 
drop a map. Then, simply unlock the door to the north of the room, and go 
through it, to room B4.

21.) B4 - In this room, another Gohma (blue colored) is here for you to fight. 
Shoot him in the eye with the Bow and Arrow three times like we did earlier on 
in the dungeon, and both doors in his lair will open. First, check the door to 
the right, which leads into room B5.

22.) B5 - In this room, there are two Pols Voices, two red Darknuts, and two 
blue Darknuts. Kill all of them, and then to gain access to the stairs in the 
middle of the room, push the left block of the box in the middle of the room, 
then go down the stairs into the basement of the room. Kill or avoid the Keeses 
down there, and grab the Magic Key, which negates using any other key in the 
game... you don't need anymore keys! Makes life so much easier. Go back 
upstairs, and then leave the room back through the left door, to room B4.

23.) B4 - The room to the north leads to some bombs, it's a waste, so don't go 
up there. Instead, go south, back to room C4.

24.) C4 - Just head south again, to room D4.

25.) D4 - Back here, you'll have to fight the blue Darknuts again. Kill them 
all, avoid the fireballs that the statue shoots, and the door to the right will 
open up, which you should now go through, to room D5.

26.) D5 - In this room, there's a plethora of enemies... Gibdos, and both kinds 
of Darknuts, as well as Bubbles. Just ignore them and go to the staircase at 
the righthand side of the room, which leads clear across the dungeon, to room 
F2.

27.) F2 - In this room, there are Pols Voices all over the place. Kill them 
all. The key in the corner of the room we don't need now that we have the Magic 
Key. Ignore the door to your left, and bomb the wall at the north of the room, 
which leads to the boss lair. The boss here is Gleeok, and we've fought him 
before, so fear not. This is room D2.

28.) D2 - Gleeok's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - G L E E O K

Gleeok is back, but he's just as simple (actually, he's more simple now, we 
have the Magical Sword this time around) as when we fought him earlier in the 
game, in the fourth dungeon, I believe. Run up to Gleeok and slash at him. 
Don't worry about getting hit by fireballs, just slash at his heads. Each two 
hits, one head will die, and it'll float around the room, as the enemy "Head of 
Gleeok." Finish Gleeok off totally with eight hits of the Magical Sword. He's 
really easy, just be tenacious and don't worry about playing defense with this 
guy. It's really not worth it.

After Gleeok is defeated, go north to room C2.

29.) C2 - In this room, grab the Triforce, and you'll be automatically healed 
and transported outside of the dungeon.

Once outside of the dungeon, we can go to Death Mountain. Before you go, make 
sure to visit a Fairy and get your life refilled, all 16 hearts! Also, go to 
the Old Woman and buy a Red Potion if you haven't got one already in your 
inventory. Bombs should also be stocked up to 16, and rupees, to 25 at least, 
which is the equivelant of 25 arrows, of course. When you're ready, head back 
to the origin and follow these directions to get to Death Mountain.

From the origin, go right, and then up all the way until you can't go up 
anymore. Then, go left, and up once more. Cross over the river with the 
stepladder, and go up the staircase to the left of the river, into the Death 
Mountain region. Go left two screens, until you get to a screen with two rocks, 
the "Spectacle Rocks." Bomb the left rock in the middle, towards the right a 
bit, to make a door. Enter into the door, and welcome to Death Mountain!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.) DUNGEON NINE  - "Death Mountain"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The map of the final dungeon is laid out a bit differently than the 
previous eight dungeon maps I've provided you with in the walkthrough. Being 
that Death Mountain is so massive, and you can avoid going to most of it en 
route to slaying Ganon, I've mapped out the parts you need to go to, and 
nothing more. The "T1", "T2", et cetera, are teleports, so to speak, like we've 
seen in other dungeons. Since there are so many, and they lead straight across 
this massive dungeon, I've now put them on the map. Therefore, T1 in one place 
corresponds with T1 in another place. As the map segements go down, you are 
farther into the dungeon, so they are also in sequential order, for ease. Hope 
they help.

Death Mountain is the final stage in the first quest. Death Mountain is big and 
hard, but one thing you have to realize about Death Mountain is, out of the 58 
(!) rooms in the dungeon, you don't have to visit even half of those, if you do 
things right. You can still get the Red Ring and the Silver Arrows and avoid a 
lot of annoyances. Just follow the walkthrough, and you'll get those two items 
and to Ganon in no time, trust me my friends.

1.) C2 (entrance) - As you enter the dungeon, go up to room B2.

2.) B2 - In this room, there would be an Old Man telling you to go back, but 
since you've beaten all eight dungeons, there's nothing here, and doors to the 
left and north open up. Go through the north door, to room C2.

3.) C2 - In this room, there are Bubbles, Like Likes, and Zols, two of each. 
Avoid the enemies being that all they drop is a key (you don't need anymore, 
remember!), and bomb the middle of the lefthand wall, to make a hole. Go 
through the hole in the wall, to room C1.

4.) C1 - In this room, there are two of a new enemy, called Lanmolas. You have 
to attack their bodies first, and then their heads after all of their body 
segments are defeated. They are basically stronger, faster versions of the 
Moldorm. Kill both of them, and then move the block to the left of the large 
box in the middle of the room, to get to the staircase. Take the staircase, 
which will teleport you to another part of the dungeon, to room E1.

5.) E1 - In this room, kill the Like Likes as you go around the huge spiral in 
the room. Ignore the open door leading south, and instead, use the Magic Key on 
the door to the right of the room, which leads into room E2.

6.) E2 - When you get into this room, use the Red Candle right away, and start 
blocking the spells coming your way from the blue Wizzrobes in the room. Engage 
them in battle if you'd like, but I'd save your energy if I were you. Instead, 
go to the south wall, and place a bomb in the middle of it. Go through the hole 
you make in the wall, down to room F2.

7.) F2 - In this room, shoot straight down the path laid out for you, and place 
a bomb in the middle of the south wall here as well. Go through the hole, into 
the next room, room G2.

8.) G2 - This room is dark, like an Old Man's room, for whatever reason. There 
are four Wizzrobes in here for you to kill. Kill all of them (be careful with 
your energy!) and then grab the Compass that they drop after they die. Then go 
up one room, back to room F2.

9.) F2 - Here, just head back up again, to room E2.

10.) E2 - Back in this room, don't bother with a Red Candle or anything, just 
walk to the door at the right of the room, and go through it, to room E3.

11.) E3 - In this room, there is a Patra, a new enemy we've yet to encounter on 
our quest. It's a floating eyeball surrounded by some sort of debris, I can't 
really make it out. In anycase, you can kill it if you want, but I wouldn't 
waste your time. Just go through the southern door, to room F3.

12.) F3 - This room, strangely enough, is occupied by some weak Gels. Ignore 
them, and go to the middle of the righthand wall, where you should place a 
bomb. A hole in the wall will now be there for you to go through, to room F4.

13.) F4 - Another Patra resides in this room, and this time, you'll have to 
kill it, if you want the Map of the huge dungeon. Patras are indeed a pain in 
the ass to defeat, but sometimes, you must do what you don't want to do. To 
slay a Patra, walk up to the debris surrounding him and hack at them to destroy 
them (two hits each with the Magical Sword). Only when all of that debris is no 
longer orbiting him is he vulnerable to your attack. Then, you can just attack 
the eyeball itself. When he is defeated, a Map will appear in the room for you 
to use. Beautiful. Now, we can go get the Red Ring, the next item on our trail. 
From this room, bomb the middle of the north wall, and walk through the hole 
you make there, to room E4.

14.) E4 - In this room, there are a plethora of toughies for you to slay. 
Wizzrobes and Like Likes galore. Ignore them all however, and dash to the top 
wall, and bomb the middle of it. Go through the hole in the wall, to room D4.

15.) D4 - In this room, so many Wizzrobes for you to kill. You have to kill 
them all, and avoid the Bubbles. When all the Wizzrobes are killed, push the 
left block in that box in the middle of the room, and go down the stairs there. 
Kill or avoid the Keeses down here, and grab the Red Ring! The Red Ring is an 
AWESOME item that is twice as powerful as the Blue Ring... in other words, you 
now take half of the damage that you would with the Blue Ring equipped, or one 
fourth the damage with out any ring equipped! It's a beautiful thing. In 
anycase, head back upstairs, and back south, to room E4.

16.) E4 - Back in this room, go south again, to room F4.

17.) F4 - Back here, go left, to room F3.

18.) F3 - Now, go north, back to the original Patra room, room E3.

19.) E3 - Avoid or kill the Patra, as he's in front of the door we need to get 
to, the locked one to the north of the room. When you get around the Patra, or 
kill him, go to the north door, unlock it with the Magic Key, and go through 
it, to room D3.

20.) D3 - The old man simply tells you here to go to the next room. Since there 
are no doors in his room, break out your trusty bombs. Bomb the middle of the 
lefthand wall, and go through the hole in the wall, to the next room, room D2.

21.) D2 - In this room, there are five Wizzrobes - three blue, two red. Slay 
all five of them, and then go to the block at the left side of the room, and 
push it over, to reveal a hidden staircase in the upper righthand corner of the 
room. Take the staircase down into the basement, and come up on the other side, 
in room K4.

22.) K4 - Over here, you'll be in a room with five weak enemies, Zols. Kill 
them and grab whatever they drop. Then, open the door to the left of the room 
with the Magic Key, and go into the room there, room K3.

23.) K3 - In this dark, "old man" style room, there are numerous Keeses. Kill 
them, or avoid them, and go left into the next room, room K2.

24.) K2 - In this room, there is yet another Patra for you to deal with. Since 
you need to gain access to the stairs in the middle of the room, you'll have to 
slay this Patra, so do that, and then push the leftmost block up or down, to 
gain access to the staircase in the middle of the room. Take it into the 
basement, and come up on the other side, room L1.

25.) M1 - In this room, there is a plethora of Wizzrobes. Ignore and avoid all 
of them, and place a bomb in the middle of the northern wall, to bust a hole 
through that wall, leading north to room L1.

26.) L1 - In this room are more Wizzrobes and Bubbles. Kill the Wizzrobes and 
avoid the Bubbles. When all of the Wizzrobes are slain, push the middle block 
on the vertical block row, to make a staircase appear in the upper righthand 
corner of the room. Take it into the room's basement, and grab the Silver 
Arrows down there! Now, go back up to the main floor, and go back south, to 
room M1.

27.) M1 - Since we now need to get back to those stairs, those Wizzrobes are 
going to have all be killed. Kill them all, and once again, push that left 
block out of the way, and take the stairs back to the other side, where the 
Patra was earlier, room K2.

28.) K2 - Back in the room (now void of a Patra), head north, to room J2.

29.) J2 - In here, carefull kill all of the Like Likes (don't let them take 
your Magic Shield!), and the door at the lefthand side of the room will open up 
for you. Take that door to room J1.

30.) J1 - In this dark room, don't waste your time with the Red Candle. There 
are only Zols in here. Just go to the north door and open it with your Magic 
Key, and go into room I1.

31.) I1 - This room has three Wizzrobes in it... three Wizzrobes we don't have 
to deal with. Avoid them best you can and open the door to the north of this 
room with the Magic Key, and go into room H1.

32.) H1 - This room has Wizzrobes and Traps, and the Wizzrobes do have to be 
killed here. While carefull avoiding the traps, kill the Wizzrobes in the room, 
and then push the lefthand block in the room, to reveal a staircase in the 
upper righthand corner of the room. Take it down into the basement, and come up 
in another area of the dungeon, in room N2. (since the stairs come up under a 
Trap, you have to trigger the Trap, then run to the staircase before the Trap 
resets itself).

33.) N2 - As you resurface, you'll be in a room full of Traps and Wizzrobes, 
and Bubbles as well. Avoid everything the best you can and work your way to the 
lefthand side of the room. Trigger the traps, then move out of the way as they 
come together. When they are going back to reset themselves, place a bomb in 
the middle of that wall and blow a hole in it, and quickly run through it 
before the Traps come back to injure you. You're now in room N1.

34.) N1 - In this room, there are two Bubbles, two Zols and two Like Likes. 
Kill the Like Likes carefully, and the Zols as well. When those are defeated, 
push the block at the left of the room up or down, and go down the stairs in 
the middle of the room, coming up on the other side, in room Q1.

35.) Q1 - You're right before Ganon's room! There's a Patra guarding the 
entrance. Kill the Patra, and then go north, to Ganon's lair... get ready for 
the last boss battle, in room P1.

36.) P1 - Ganon's Boss Chamber...

BOSS BATTLE - G A N O N

The boss battle with Ganon is more of a novelty than anything, if you ask me, 
because it really lacks any difficulty at all. As you walk into the room where 
he is, Link takes out the Triforce and the room is lit up. To let you know 
right away, you CAN walk on the black parts of the floor, the hole room is 
walkable, regardless of color, so those AREN'T holes in the floor. Ganon will 
disappear and shoot unblockable fireballs at you. Stab around the room a bit 
and you'll hit him, and he'll reappear, but then disappear. You have to do this 
to him four times, and then he'll turn a brown color. This is when you have to 
break out the Bow and Silver Arrow. One hit with the Silver Arrow will turn the 
evil Ganon into dust, and open the door to the north of his room, which leads 
to Zelda's holding chamber. See, Ganon wasn't that hard... which is a shame... 
'cause he never is in any of the Zelda games he appears in, if you think about 
it. Ah well.

After Ganon is defeated, go north to room O1.

In this room, slay the fires surrounding Zelda with your mighty Magical Sword, 
and walk up to her. You've defeated the game, CONGRATULATIONS!

MAJOR SPOILERS! READ BELOW ONLY IF YOU KNOW THAT THE BELOW PARAGRAPH(S) EXPLAIN 
THE ENDING OF THE GAME!

The ending of The Legend of Zelda is nothing spectacular. After you slay Ganon, 
and go into Zelda's holding chamber, you kill the fires surrounding her, and 
she embraces you. Then you and Zelda both hold up pieces of the Triforce. She 
says to you, "Thanks Link. You're the hero of Hyrule." Then the screen says, 
"Finally, peace returns to Hyrule. This ends the story." 

After that, a short credits list scrolls, and then the screen tells you that a 
second quest will continue the game! Awesome! Then a piece of the Triforce is 
seen inserted in the dusty pile of Ganon's remains... and that is all...

This part of the FAQ/Walkthrough are several lists of various items, weapons, 
and accessories that are found throughout the world of Hyrule, for your 
convenience.

------ -----
Common Items
------ -----

-Name: RUPEES
-Use: Hyrule's monetary unit
-Where Found/How Obtained: Kill enemies, and some of them sometimes drop 
rupees. Sometimes, you can even find large sums of rupees in hidden areas...
-Description: There are two forms of rupees. One rupee piece and five rupee 
piece. The one rupee piece is gold, and is common after defeating an enemy. A 
five rupee piece is blue in color, and far rarer to get after an enemy is 
defeated, although they still show up.

-----

-Name: CLOCK
-Use: Freezes On-Screen Enemies
-Where Found/How Obtained: Rarely dropped by enemies after they are defeated.
-Description: The Clock is a pretty useful item dropped by enemies after they 
are defeated in battle. Pick up the clock, and all enemies on the screen will 
freeze, so that you can easily defeat them and take their wares. Link will 
flash when this frozen state is obtained. The time stays frozen until you leave 
the screen.

-----

-Name: HEART
-Use: Refills one heart container
-Where Found/How Obtained: When you defeat an enemy, they sometimes drop 
hearts.
-Description: The heart is an important item that enemies drop after they meet 
their demise in battle. Pick them up and one heart container will be refilled 
on your health meter... not a bad deal.

-----

-Name: FAIRY
-Use: Refills many heart containers
-Where Found/How Obtained: Very rare items dropped by enemies after they are 
defeated.
-Description: Fairies are famous Zelda "items" but they are actually alive. 
When they are released by their enemy captor, they fly around the screen. Catch 
the fairy and she'll refill your health to a certain degree, far more than a 
single heart can.

------- -----
Dungeon Items
------- -----

-Name: MAP
-Use: See the layout of a dungeon.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Each dungeon has one map within it. They are hidden 
all in various places, in various ways, depending on the particular dungeon.
-Description: The map is a very important item to find within a dungeon, 
especially if you're attempting to defeat a dungeon on your own, with no 
outside help. It should be your first objective upon entering any new dungeon, 
and is usually located around the beginning of the dungeon.

-----

-Name: COMPASS
-Use: Puts the location of the dungeon boss on the map.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Each dungeon has one compass within it. They are 
hidden all in various places, in various ways, depending on the particular 
dungeon.
-Description: The compass isn't quite as vital an item as the map, but it's 
pretty important none-the-less, and should be sought out after the map is 
acquired in each dungeon. The compass, once you have the map, pin points the 
location of the dungeon boss on the map, for your convenience.

-----

-Name: KEY
-Use: Opens regular locked doors.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Found in various places, hidden in various ways, in 
dungeons. You can also buy them at various stores around Hyrule.
-Description: The Key is a vital item, found in all the dungeons in the game. 
You need them to open locked doors within the dungeon, of which there are 
usually several, to many. If you can't seem to find a key in a dungeon, but 
there's a locked door within the dungeon, you can go to stores around Hyrule 
and buy a key. There is ALWAYS a key for a door, however, within the dungeon... 
you just have to find it.

-------
Weapons [in order of how you acquire them in the game, sequentially]
-------

-Name: WOODEN SWORD
-Use: Hack and slash enemies
-Where Found/How Obtained: In the beginning of the game, go to the cave in the 
north of the screen you're in, and the old man there will give you the Wooden 
Sword.
-Description: The Wooden Sword is the first weapon Link recieves in the game, 
and is pretty weak indeed. However, if you play the game correctly, you'll have 
to use it for all of 15 or 20 minutes. Once you get six heart containers, which 
can be done before you even go to the first dungeon, you can get the White 
Sword from a mysterious old man, which is twice as powerful as the Wooden 
Sword. So don't worry about it too much. =)

-----

-Name: BOMBS
-Use: Blow up walls, rocks, and enemies.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Many enemies drop these after you defeat them, and 
you can also buy them for 20 rupees (for four bombs) at several shops around 
Hyrule.
-Description: The Bombs are fundamental Zelda weapons. Although you can use 
them as weapons, to blow enemies up, their real important use is to blow holes 
in faulty walls in dungeons, or to make cave entrances on the overworld. You 
can only carry eight bombs at a time.

-----

-Name: WHITE SWORD
-Use: A sword that is twice as powerful as the Wooden Sword
-Where Found/How Obtained: Once the hearts in your reserve equal six or over, 
you are eligable to get the White Sword. Go to the old man in a cave around 
Hyrule (see the map above the walkthrough section, or the walkthrough itself 
for an exact location), and he'll give it to you in exchange for the weaker 
Wooden Sword.
-Description: The White Sword is the sword you'll be using almost the entire 
game, being that you use the Wooden Sword for maybe 20 minutes, and you can't 
get the stronger Magical Sword (which is twice as powerful as the White Sword) 
until you get 12 hearts in your reserve. The White Sword is quite ample, 
however, as it is twice as strong as the Wooden Sword, and does its job rather 
nicely, indeed.

-----

-Name: BOOMERANG
-Use: Stun enemies, kill weaker, smaller enemies.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Kill the three Goriyas in the first dungeon, and 
they'll drop the Boomerang.
-Description: The Boomerang is a pretty useful weapon to have, for it's a 
projectile weapon that can stun almost all enemies, not allowing them to move. 
In this paralyzed state, you can easily walk up to an enemy and slash his non-
moving body to bits and pieces. Smaller, weaker enemies, like Gels, can be 
killed completly with one hit of the Boomerang.

-----

-Name: BOW AND ARROW
-Use: The ultimate projectile weapon... use it to kill enemies from afar.
-Where Found/How Obtained: The bow is found in the basement of the first 
dungeon. Arrows are dropped by enemies, and can also be bought for 80 gold from 
many shops around Hyrule.
-Description: The Bow and Arrow is truly the ultimate projectile weapon. Once 
you acquire it, you'll find that it's almost always in the B button box, ready 
to be used. Use it to kill enemies from a safe distance, or to kill out of 
reach or strong enemies from a distance, where you can hurt them, but they 
can't hurt you. It's that simple with the Bow and Arrow. Link can carry up to 
30 arrows at one time in his reserve.

-----

-Name: MAGIC BOOMERANG
-Use: A stronger version of the regular Boomerang that flies farther than its 
predecessor.
-Where Found/How Obtained: The Magic Boomerang is the special item found in the 
second dungeon... grab it from a group of nasty Goriyas. =)
-Description: There's not much to be said about the Magic Boomerang... it's 
identical to the regular Boomerang... it just does more damage and can fly 
farther, that's basically it. It's almost like our friends at Nintendo ran out 
of ideas for items, so they threw this garbage into the game for shits and 
giggles. =P

-----

-Name: MAGICAL SWORD
-Use: A sword that's twice as strong as the White Sword, and four times 
stronger than the Wooden Sword.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's in the graveyard... at coordinate C2. See the 
big map above the walkthrough, if you so please.
-Description: The Magical Sword is the most powerful sword in the game. Four 
times stronger than the Wooden Sword, and twice as strong as the White Sword, 
it makes mincemeat out of all the enemies in Hyrule, making your life a whole 
lot easier, indeed. The only catch is, you have to have at least 12 hearts in 
your reserves to be able to get the Magical Sword. Hence, the earliest you can 
get the Magical Sword is right before going to the fifth dungeon. That's when 
you should get it.

-----

-Name: MAGIC WAND
-Use: The most powerful non-sword weapon in the game, it can shoot magical 
energy straight across any room, seriously damaging all enemies but Wizzrobes.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's the special item found in the sixth dungeon of 
the game.
-Description: The Magic Wand is a pretty useful weapon, believe it or not. 
Consider it a stronger version of the bow and arrow, one that does more damage, 
travels faster, and doesn't take rupees or anything else to use. Once you get 
the Magic Wand, use it as a long distance attacking powerhouse, with no penalty 
to use it at all. Use it with regularity, and you'll learn that it'll be your 
best friend for the rest of the game after you acquire it... just know that it 
doesn't damage the powerful Wizzrobes, who use an identical weapon. Just 
letting you know, so you're informed. =)

-----

-Name: SILVER ARROW
-Use: Ganon's weakness, the only way he can be totally destroyed. Takes the 
place of the regular arrow when obtained.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's one of two items found in Death Mountain at the 
end of the game, before you battle Ganon in the final fight.
-Description: The Silver Arrow is nothing special, and you'll likely only use 
it once, in the final battle of the game, and not before that. It takes the 
place of the regular arrow, and is Ganon's weakness after you slash him enough 
with the Magical Sword, and he turns brown. That's when you know to give him 
one shot with the Silver Arrow to end his reign of terror, and turn him into 
dust, permanently.

----- ----- -----
Other Vital Items
----- ----- -----

-Name: BLUE CANDLE
-Use: Burns secret bushes, revealing new passageways, stairs, et cetera.
-Where Found/How Obtained: You can buy it from a few shops around Hyrule.
-Description: The Blue Candle isn't exactly a must have item, but you should 
definetly pick it up first thing as you start a new journey. It's uses are 
immeasureable... use the Blue Candle to burn down certain bushes around Hyrule 
to reveal secret passageways and staircases, that often reveal valuable items. 
You can only use the Blue Candle once per screen, so to use it again on a 
screen you've already used it on, you'll have to leave the screen and then go 
back to use it again.

-----

-Name: BLUE RING
-Use: Cuts damage inflicted by enemies onto Link by half.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Purchase from a certain shop in Hyrule for 250 
rupees... it's worth EVERY rupee, and then some.
-Description: The Blue Ring is a vital item. Thankfully, you can acquire it 
before you even get to the first dungeon... you just have to save up the 250 
rupees it costs to buy. The Blue Ring cuts the damage inflicted by enemies onto 
Link in half, meaning that if an enemy takes away one heart on Link normally, 
he'll now take half a heart away. If an enemy usually takes half a heart away, 
it not takes him two hits to take away that half a heart. It turns Link's tunic 
blue, too, which makes you know it's working. Very useful indeed!

-----

-Name: LETTER
-Use: Allows various old women around Hyrule to sell you potions of healing.
-Where Found/How Obtained: An old man in the northeastern corner of Hyrule, 
hiding in a cave, will give you the letter.
-Description: The Letter has one use; to make the old women around Hyrule sell 
you the Red and Blue Potions they are famous for (see below), which gives you a 
portable healing device to bring with you around Hyrule, and more importantly, 
to dungeons.

-----

-Name: RED AND BLUE POTIONS [Medicine]
-Use: Refills your heart containers.
-Where Found/How Obtained: After you get the Letter from the old man in Hyrule, 
show it to old women scattered in caves across Hyrule, and they'll sell you 
Blue Potion for 40 rupees, and Red Potion for 68 rupees.
-Description: The potions are very important items to have. When you select to 

use the potions, your empty heart containers will be filled up. It's that 
simple. The difference between the two colors is simple - they both have the 
same healing properties, it's just that you can use the Red Potion twice, while 
the Blue Potion can be used only once. So a Red Potion that is used once will 
turn into a Blue Potion, you see.

-----

-Name: RAFT
-Use: Allows you to cross bodies of water.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's the main item to find in Dungeon three, but you 
don't actually use it until you are trying to get to the fourth dungeon... but 
you still need it.
-Description: The raft simply allows Link to cross various bodies of water 
around Hyrule, and it's the only way you can get to Dungeon Four, so naturally, 
it's considered a "vital" item, just like every other item in the game you find 
in the dungeons. =P Not much else could be said about the Raft... it's a boring 
item, but a necessary one, none-the-less.

-----

-Name: STEPLADDER
-Use: Allows you to cross bodies of water one square long.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's the main item to find in Dungeon four, and 
unlike the Raft, you'll actually need it in the dungeon you find it in. Go 
figure. =)
-Description: The Stepladder is a step down from the Raft, which makes me 
wonder why we get it after the Raft, but whatever... I didn't design the game, 
now did I. =) Use the Stepladder to cross bodies of water one square wide in 
the game, or as I call them in the walkthrough, rivers. You can use it on the 
overworld, but it's more useful in dungeons than anywhere else. You can't get 
through dungeon four without it, either, so make sure to find it, or you won't 
go very far!

-----

-Name: POWER BRACELET
-Use: Use it to push, lift, and move large rocks and boulders around the lands 
of Hyrule.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Underneath an Armos chillin' at coordinate C5, on 
the map above the walkthrough.
-Description: The Power Bracelet is another vital item to have in the game. 
With it, you can push, lift, and move rocks and boulders, opening up new areas 
of Hyrule for you to explore, as well as allowing you to find many a new 
secret, making the game longer, more fun, and more enjoyable. All in all, it's 
a good item to have, and you'll need it sooner or later, so why not get it 
sooner?

-----

-Name: WHISTLE
-Use: Use it in the fifth dungeon on Digdogger, to make him smaller, and in 
that case, easier to kill. Oh, and it's a teleporter... so to speak.
-Where Found/How Obtained: Grab it in the fifth dungeon in the game, in the 
basement of the dungeon.
-Description: The Whistle is a pretty useless item... one of those infamous 
Zelda items you get for one reason, and one reason only - to kill a boss. Well 
that, and to get to the last dungeon in the game When you get the Whistle, you 
can blow it at any time to make some pretty music with it, but its primary use 
is when you're battling the fifth dungeon's boss, Digdogger. Use it on him and 
he'll shrink in size, becoming helpless to the might of your Magical Sword, 
which you can they slay him with in two slashes. Other than that, a pretty 
useless item if I do say so myself.

-----

-Name: RED CANDLE
-Use: The Red Candle is basically a hyped up, more useful version of the old 
Blue Candle we used for most of the game.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's the special item/weapon found in dungeon seven.
-Description: The Red Candle is pretty lame, they just threw it in the seventh 
dungeon of the game so you'd have something to get. =) The Red Candle takes 
care of the annoyance of the Blue Candle, however. That is to say, with the 
Blue Candle, you can only use it once per screen, and you have to leave the 
screen and go back to the screen to use it again in case you messed up or 
needed to try it again. The Red Candle aleviates that problem by allowing you 
unlimited use of the candle's fire in any room, on any screen, as much as you 
want. It's a cool upgrade, but such a "blah" item. =)

-----

-Name: MAGIC BOOK
-Use: Simply makes the Magic Wand shoot a more powerful magic, in the form of 
fire.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's one of two items found in the eighth dungeon.
-Description: The Magic Book is pretty useless, but it's also pretty cool, 
because it gives your Magic Wand a huge power up, because the magic shot out of 
it is now fire, which apparently does more damage to enemies in the land of 
Hyrule. While many people go the entire game without using the Magic Wand 
period, you might wanna try the Magic Wand with the Magic Book in your 
inventory on certain enemies. It's a very powerful long range weapon that is 
often overlooked by many Zelda players, even those who are experienced in the 
game. Give it a whirl if you feel like it. Of course, it's not necessary.

-----

-Name: MAGIC KEY
-Use: The Magic Key is basically a regular key that can be used over and over 
again, negating all other keys in the game. Makes life easier.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's one of two items found in the eighth dungeon.
-Description: Ah yes, the Magic Key. A very useful item indeed. When you get 
the Magic Key, it's in the eighth dungeon, which is basically late in the game 
where you don't need Keys anyway, but the Magic Key... well, the Magic Key 
works wonders because it negates all other keys in the game. No more key 
hunting! Use this key over and over and over again, on all locked doors in the 
game, and it won't go away! A beautiful, beautious thing indeed. At least you 
get it earlier in the game in the second quest...

-----

-Name: RED RING
-Use: Cuts damage you receive in one fourth, or one half, if you already have 
the Blue Ring equipped.
-Where Found/How Obtained: It's one of two items found in Death Mountain, 
before your final battle with Ganon.
-Description: The Red Ring is an extremly vaulable item, that not only turns 
Link a pretty shade of red, but also cuts damage he sustains in battle in one 
fourth, or one half, if you have the Blue Ring equipped already.  The Red Ring 
is found super late in the game, in Death Mountain, actually, which makes it 
kind of useless by the time you get it, but it gives you a fighting chance 
against the numerous Patras, Wizzrobes, et cetera, you find in Death Mountain, 
as well as the nemesis of the entire game, Ganon, who can do serious damage to 
you unless you have the Red Ring equipped. So definetly make sure you have it 
equipped before you go to fight Ganon, to give yourself a better chance to slay 
him.

This part of the FAQ/Walkthrough is a list of enemies. Along with the enemies 
is a description of them, which is straight out of The Legend of Zelda 
instruction manual that came with the game. So those words are Nintendo's, not 
mine. Underneath that, there is a small "battle strategy" (which I wrote, yes), 
to help you in defeat the enemy. It's super straight-forward, you'll see.

[the enemies are in alphabetical order]

----------

-Name: AQUAMENTUS
-Description: "A type of dragon that some call a unicorn. As well as having 
lots of attack power, it's a fearful opponent. It emits beams."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Aquamentus is the first boss character in the game, yes, 
which you can find inside the first dungeon. However, in later dungeons, he 
appears as a regular old enemy, which is why he is in both the enemy section 
and boss section of my guide. So leave me alone about it! =D Aquamentus is easy 
to defeat. Although his description in the instruction manual makes him sound 
menacing, he's not. He hardly moves, and shoots three fireballs every few 
seconds that can be avoided if you place yourself right. Then you can get in 
close for the kill with your sword, although if you have full health, sword 
beams do the trick, and from a safe distance. It'll just take you a bit longer 
to defeat him with the weaker sword beams.

----------

-Name: ARMOS
-Description: "A soldier who has been turned into a stone statue. He moves and 
attacks if touched by Link. He has a fair amount of attacking power."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: You never have to fight an Armos. The only way you can wake 
them up is if you physically touch them, which can always be avoided if you're 
careful. They are often in huge packs, however, and you'll have to carefull 
wind yourself through them in order to not touch them, which can be a tricky 
and difficult proposition. If you do fight one, they move fast, so hack, run a 
bit, turn around and hack again, continuing the process until he's defeated. Be 
weary of groups of them, if you awaken more than one. That's when they can be 
particularly tough to defeat.

----------

-Name: BUBBLE
-Description: "The spirit of the dead. When it clings onto Link, he won't be 
able to unsheath his sword for a while."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: The Bubble is an enemy that is better left alone then 
anything. You can't damage him with your sword... actually, quite the opposite. 
If he touches you, Link can get his sword out of his sheath for a few seconds, 
making Bubbles extremly annoying when teamed up with our enemies that you CAN 
kill, and that are trying to kill you at the same time. Bubbles move fast and 
eratically, so do your best to avoid them, and kill everything else in the 
room, while leaving them be. It's your best bet to get out of a room with them 
alive.

----------

-Name: DARKNUT
-Description: "The knight who lives in the labyrinths. He has lots of attacking 
power. He repels Link's attacks from the front with his shield."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Darknuts start appearing in the dungeons about midway through 
the game. While they aren't difficult to defeat at all, they are simply a pain 
in the butt because they can use a shield, and they use it well. You can't 
attack them head on, while they're facing you. You have to get to the side or 
back of them and take some shots at them. Two hits with the White Sword will do 
them in for good, but be careful, as they often change directions and can run 
into you easily while you're attacking them. That's why you want to be careful 
with them. They don't have any active attacks, but running into you still does 
pretty good damage... half a heart with the Blue Ring equipped.

----------

-Name: DIGDOGGER
-Description: "Big sea urchins. In spite of their big bodies, they shrivel up 
when attacked. But watch out! They come on pretty strong."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Digdogger is indeeed the fifth dungeon's boss enemy, but you 
encounter him in later levels as a regular enemy. He's large at first, but if 
you use the Whistle on him (like you did when you fought him as a boss in 
dungeon five), he'll shrink in size tremendously, therefore making him easy to 
slay with your slew of weaponry. He's easy to defeat and has no attacks, but is 
usually stationed in a room with other enemies that can attack, or with statues 
that do the attacking for him. Either way, equipped with the Whistle, he can do 
you know harm. As the old man says, he hates noise!

----------

-Name: DODONGO
-Description: "A giant rhinoceros. It hasn't got so much attacking power, but 
it bounces off attacks with its thick hide."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Our friend Dodongo. The boss character in the second dungeon, 
the Dodongo becomes a run of the mill enemy in later dungeons in the game. He 
doesn't attack, he just walks around. His only weakness is to bombs. Nothing 
else can penetrate his thick skin, but bombs can! Place a bomb in his path as 
he walks, and the Dodongo will eat it up, and explode from the inside. All it 
takes is two bombs and a little patience (and love!), and the Dodongo will bite 
the dust.

----------

-Name: GEL
-Description: "Jelly-like monsters that walk about bouncing around in the 
labyrinths. When Link cuts Zol, it splits into two Gels. Gel has little 
attacking power, but Zol has twice the power of Gels."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Gels are little slime-like enemies that hop slowly around 
dungeons. They are far more dangerous in their bigger, stronger version, Zol, 
but when they are in their Gel like state, they're little more than easy 
targets. Take them out and grab whatever they drop... their attack power is 
non-existant, and one slash or hit with basically any weapon will do them in 
easily.

----------

-Name: GHINI
-Description: "The ghost who lives in the graveyard. There are two types. There 
are Ghinis who are there from the beginning of the game, and those who appear 
when Link touches the gravestones. Ghinis have about the same attacking force 
as Armos."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Ghinis are found exclusivly in the graveyards of the Hyrule 
overworlds, and are one of the more difficult overworld enemies to do battle 
with. While they automatically appear in the graveyards as you enter them, 
touching a grave will make them appear as well. They can take quite a beating 
when you attack them, and although they move slow and have no attacks, they 
often drop rupees and other valuables, making them enticing to fight, even if 
you don't want to. However, they are slow enough to give you an option to fight 
them or not... so do whatever you'd like, m'friends. 

----------

-Name: GIBDO
-Description: "The mummy man. He's got some strange powers, and some pretty 
powerful attacking force."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Gibdos are hardly fierce, and they have no real attacks, 
although if they run into you, they can do some pretty nice damage. These guys 
are basically mummies that move around in packs. They move fast and 
sporatically, but are still easy to slay, especially with the Magical Sword 
equipped in hand. Slash at them once or twice, then move away to avoid getting 
hit in their path of speed, and then repeat the process if necessary on any 
other ones. These enemies shouldn't be feared too much, and starting in dungeon 
five, they can easily be called "dungeon commons", for they appear with great 
regularity in dungeons from the fifth dungeon on in the game... but you should 
be glad you're fighting these guys than say... Darknuts. =)

----------

-Name: GLEEOK
-Description: "A huge dragon that has 2 to 4 heads and spits out beams at Link. 
Heads that Link cuts off from its body fly around in the air."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Yes, Gleeok is the fourth dungoen boss, but later on in the 
game, he appears as a regular enemy for you to battle with. He's a lot like 
Aquamentus in looks (except Aquamentus is green, while Gleeok is blue), but his 
battle pattern is the same. He stays still and shoots fireballs at you. That's 
all. =) However, you have to get in close to attack him (unless you have full 
energy, in which case you can shoot sword beams at him from afar), and since 
Gleeok's attack power is pretty high, it can make life difficult for certain. 
Simply avoid or block his fireballs and hack away at his head. When you do 
enough damage, one of his heads will come off of his body (see HEAD OF GLEEOK 
in this section for more on that). Just be tenacious with your attacks on 
Gleeok, and he'll fall quickly to your mighty sword. ^_~

----------

-Name: GOHMA
-Description: "The super huge crab that lives in the labyrinths. Its hard shell 
will repulse any attack. Attacks its weak point with a special weapon."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Gohma is the boss enemy of the sixth dungeon in the game, but 
is also found in later dungeons after the sixth dungeon as a regular old enemy, 
that you can fight. The strategy against any Gohma you encounter is the same, 
however. Avoid or block the fireballs he shoots at you as he wonders and runs 
around his lair. His eye is almost always closed, but you're waiting for it to 
open. Why? Because that's the only time he's vulnerable to attack. When he 
opens his eye for a second or two, equip the bow and arrow and shoot an arrow 
at his eye. If you shoot it accuratly, it'll hit his eye and do him in with one 
measly hit of an arrow! Excellent! =)

----------

-Name: GORIYA
-Description: "A little devil that lives underground. He uses boomerangs. There 
are two of his type, blue ones and red ones. Watch out for the blue ones! They 
are strong."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Goriyas come in two varities - blue and red. Both attack in 
the same way though, with Boomerangs. Being that they use their boomerangs with 
great accuracy and skill, avoid their projectile attacks the best you can. Your 
best bet is to get to them from behind, and slash away with your sword, 
although your bow and arrow is also an ample weapon to use against these 
enemies. Using a boomerang on them is pretty futile, but if you use one with as 
much skill as the Goriya himself, perhaps it's worth a shot to freeze up the 
enemy and take him out when he's paralyzed.

----------

-Name: HEAD OF GLEEOK
-Description: -
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: The Head of Gleeok is the boss/dungeon enemy Gleeok's head, 
that turns red and flies around the room, after you do enough damage to a 
regular old Gleeok. While it flies around the room quickly, it shoots fireballs 
at you from all angles, making your job difficult. But don't worry too much 
about the Head of Gleeok. Focus your attacks on the regular Gleeok even after 
the Head of Gleeok dispatches itself from the Gleeok's body and starts shooting 
at you, and keep hacking away at the Gleeok's body. When the Gleeok's body 
dies, so will the Head of Gleeok, effectivly killing two birds with one stone. 
Voila. =)

----------

-Name: KEESE
-Description: "Vire is a devil that controls the Keeses. When Link cuts it with 
his sword, it turns into two Keeses. Keeses have little attacking power, but 
Vire is a little stronger."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Keese are the weakest dungeon enemies, but they are still 
pains in the butt, because of their small size and speed. Since these bat-like 
enemies always attack in groups, they have the tendency to swarm, and thereby 
confuse, their enemies. Take slashes at them to kill them, and gather the 
numerous items they drop, but be careful not to be overtaken by them. They can 
downsize your energy quickly, and you might not even know it. Take advantage of 
their start-and-stop motions to make them easier targets then they would be if 
they always just kept on moving.

----------

-Name: LANMOLA
-Description: "A gigantic centipede. Attacking his head won't work. Boy! Does 
he move fast!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Lanmola's are underworld enemies that are exclusivly found in 
Death Mountain, the final dungeon in our Hyrule adventure. They are basically 
larger, stronger, faster versions of their orange counterparts, Moldorms. These 
guys move fast, and attack for big damage. You have to keep swining your sword 
at them to make their bodies smaller, until only a head with no segments behind 
it is running around the room. Then, you can slay their head (which moves very 
fast, and is hard to hit with no segments behind it), and kill them for good. 
They are pretty rare to find, and are only found in Death Mountain, but when 
you do run across these guys, get ready for a real battle, because these guys 
will definetly give you a hard time.

----------

-Name: LEEVER
-Description: "They live in the ground and eat up the energy of creatures that 
approach them. Blue Leevers are a little stronger, but the red ones don't have 
much attacking power."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Leevers are common overworld enemies that you'll run into 
often, especially in areas that have water in them, such as beaches and river 
coastlines. They can dig into the ground and come out of the ground in a 
completly different area, making them pretty difficult to defeat, especially 
early on in the game. Until you are confident in your attacking ability, your 
best bet would probably be to avoid these menaces. Just be careful! They seem 
to chase you, and can take quite a beating even if you do decide to attack 
them.

----------

-Name: LIKE LIKE
-Description: "A tube-like monster that has a soft spot for magic shields - he 
eats them up."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Likes Likes look harmless enough, but they can actually be 
the most annoying dungeon enemy in the game, hands down. They don't have any 
attacks. In fact, Like Likes simply walk around the room doing not much of 
anything. But when you get close enough to hack at them, they are close enough 
to touch you. And when they do, they steal your Magic Shield, pending you have 
one equipped. Why does this suck? Because you won't get it back if they take 
it, and you'll have to go buy another one. And who the hell would want to do 
that? Like Likes can also take a whole lot of damage, so be weary of that as 
well. It takes five hits with the White Sword (that means ten hits with the 
Wooden Sword) to kill a Like Like. So just be careful to not lose that Magic 
Shield of yours!

----------

-Name: LYNEL
-Description: "The guardian who attacks all those who come near Death Mountain. 
Watch out! He's pretty strong, and Link's little shield can't stop his sword."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Lynels are extremly strong overworld enemies, that are 
centaur-like in stature. They hold swords, and like Link at full power, they 
shoot sword beams out of their swords, giving them both distance and power. 
Unlike Link, however, they have the ability to use the sword beam even if they 
have been damaged. Your best bet is to stay away from both the blue and red 
varieties in the early going of the game, if you want to stay alive. Later on 
in the game, you can approach and engage these guys in battle with regularity, 
for they sometimes drop items such as rupees, and whatnot. Otherwise, they are 
probably the strongest overworld enemy, and should be avoided for the most 
part.

----------

-Name: MANHANDLA
-Description: "A large man-eating flower with hands sticking out in all four 
directions. It moves faster as it loses hands. It's pretty mean. So watch out!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Whilst Manhandla is a boss, the boss in dungeon three, he 
appears in later dungeons as a regular old enemy. The funny thing about 
Manhandla is that he LOOKS menacing, while all he really is a big creature that 
moves fast, but can take a fall really quick. For a nice, quick defeat of the 
Manhandla, place a bomb in his path so that'll explode right when he gets 
there. A well placed shot will kill him in one hit. Otherwise, you'll have to 
kill him limb by limb (and he has four), with your sword. A bomb shot can also 
destroy some of his limbs, but not all. That's where the well placed bomb comes 
into play, my friends.

----------

-Name: MOLBLIN
-Description: "A bulldog-like goblin who lives in the forest. He attacks by 
throwing spears. A little bit meaner than Octorok."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Molblins are pretty annoying creatures, regardless of their 
weak attacking power, and their even weaker defensive stamina. Their real 
advantage over Link is the fact that they can chuck their spears straight 
across the screen, and they always do it in Link's direction, which means that 
when they are on the screen, it's in your best interest to keep on moving. Bare 
in mind that their spears can be blocked with any of the two shields in the 
game, just as long as you're properly positioned in front of the oncoming 
projectile. Engage them in battle from the beginning of the game... they are 
good practice for tougher enemies in the game, and often-time hold rupees for 
Link to take upon their death.

----------

-Name: MOLDORM
-Description: "The huge worm living in the labyrinths. It grows smaller as link 
attacks. Not so strong."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Moldorms are huge worms, each segment looking like a fireball 
that a statue would shoot at you. Each attack on the Moldorm takes away 
anywhere from one to all the segments of his body, depending on how good of a 
hit you get on it. The Moldorm doesn't have any attacks, it just goes around 
the room, trying to knock into its foe. They're generally easy to defeat, you 
just have to be patient, and careful that it doesn't change paths and run right 
into you.

----------

-Name: OCTOROK
-Description: "A type of octopus that lives above ground. There are two types, 
red and blue. Watch out for the blue ones. They're mean. They spit out rocks at 
Link."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Octoroks are considered to be the generic enemy in The Legend 
of Zelda, and are litered all over Hyrule. As mentioned above, there are two 
primary types of the Octorok, blue and red, which can obviously be 
differentiated by their colors. The red ones are weaker than the blues ones as 
far as how many hits it takes to defeat them, but both forms have the same 
attack and attack power. They both move around and shoot rocks out of their 
snouts, which shoot across the screen rapidly. They can be blocked by Link's 
shield however, so block their projectiles and move in close, to attack and go 
in for the kill! Initially, with the Wooden Sword, the red ones take one slash 
to defeat, while the blue ones take two slashes. With a sword upgrade, however, 
they both take one slash.

----------

-Name: PATRA
-Description: "The Patra attack in groups, in two types of formations. Both 
formations groups are strong. So be on your toes!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy:

----------

-Name: PEAHAT
-Description: "Has little attacking power. This is the ghost of a flower that 
bounces and flutters around the place. Link can eliminate it only when its 
standing still."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Peahats are frustrating enemies to defeat, because they move 
quickly all around the screen, and stop only for a very brief time, which is 
the only time they're vulnerable to any type of attack. Your best bet is to 
simply avoid these fast moving menaces, and stay out of their tracks. Trying to 
figure out exactly where they stop, and then getting to that place to attack is 
more trouble than it's worth. Even if a Peahat hits you, it's not like it's 
going to do any amount of major damage. So don't worry about them, my friends.

----------

-Name: POLS VOICE
-Description: "A ghost with big ears and a weak point - he hates loud noise."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Pols Voices look like rabbit heads with huge whiskers that 
hop around whatever room they're in, looking for a kill. They aren't hard 
enemies at all, but they do some massive damage to Link if they run into him. 
Being that they often attack in great numbers, it's sometimes hard to avoid 
them at all, so you'll have to fight them quickly, and with concise battle 
tactics. They hop around, and can hop over barriers, rivers, et cetera, making 
it impossible to isolate yourself from them as you attack them. While arrows 
are the best weapon to use on them, as they die with one or two hits with the 
arrow, the Magical Sword can subdue a Pols Voice with a few slashes. Either 
way, kill them and be careful... their movements and speed (and attack power) 
make them one of the more formidable dungeon enemies you'll encounter.

----------

-Name: ROCK
-Description: "These rocks crumble off Death Mountain and fall down to attack 
Link. He can't destroy these natural nuisances."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: The rock isn't exactly an enemy, but the instruction manual 
listed it as such, so I figured I should probably so the same. When you get 
near the Death Mountain region, there are parts of the game where rocks fall 
from the mountain onto the land you're walking on. You can't attack them or 
damage them with any weapon in the game, so you're only choice is to avoid 
them. Avoiding them can be hard, though, especially when they're all over the 
screen. Well, you'll see.

----------

-Name: ROPE
-Description: "A poisonous snake that has made the labyrinths its home. It 
senses other creatures quickly and suddenly comes after them (and Link, for 
that matter!) once it has found them out. This one hasn't got a lot of 
attacking power."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: These snake-like creatures are very common in almost all of 
the dungeons in Hyrule. They are weak, and have no attacks, but move very 
rapidly around the room they patrol, and always attack in huge packs. They're 
infamous amongst Zelda players, however, of being the creatures most likely to 
drop goods of all kinds, from Hearts and Clocks to one rupee pieces, and lots 
and lots of five rupee pieces! Attack these guys and reap all the benefits of 
what they drop, which is lots and lots of goodness galore!

----------

-Name: STALFOS
-Description: "A skeleton that's got a sword in each hand. Little attacking 
power."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Stalfos is a common dungeon enemy, and probably one of the 
weakest. These skelton knights pack a sword in each hand, but they do very 
little damage, and never actually attack. Instead, they try to run into you to 
do damage, but even if they do, the damage is very minimal. They take one or 
two hits to kill each, depending on what sword you have, and often fight in 
groups, to make themselves look more powerful. Never pass up a group of them 
however. Slay as many as you can and gather whatever they drop... they're like 
gifts, compared to other enemies you'll come across in the dungeons.

----------

-Name: STONE STATUE
-Description: "Somebody places these in the labyrinths a long time ago. They 
suddenly attack Link when he approaches them. So you've really got to watch 
out!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Stone Statues are a pain in the ass, for sure, but not really 
because of what they can do to you attack wise. The fact of the matter is that 
when you're in a room with one or more of these statues, they continuously 
shoot fireballs at Link, and they shoot them always in his direction, and it's 
constant. Although these fireballs can be blocked by use of Link's shield, you 
can't attack and destroy these statues with any weapon in your aresenal, making 
them more of a nuisance than an enemy. Just be careful of their fireballs, and 
try to move quick in any room they occupy.

----------

-Name: TEKTITE
-Description: "These spidery things jump all over the place. Red ones move 
about a lost and blue ones only move a little. Tekties have little fighting 
power."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: Tektites, like Octoroks, liter the overworld, but also like 
Octoroks, they are super easy to defeat. These guys don't have the projectile 
advantage the other enemy has, but they do have the ability to jump all over 
the screen, including to places that Link can't get to, like rocky and forested 
areas. Both the red and blue Tektites are easy to defeat, one jumping and 
moving a bit more than the other, but you should engage these enemies in battle 
whenever you see them. I've found in my own personal experiences that they drop 
the most rupees of any enemy, especially blue rupees, which are worth five 
rupees, which, of course, is a sweet deal.

----------

-Name: PATRA
-Description: "The Patra attack in groups, in two types of formations. Both 
formations groups are strong. So be on your toes!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Patras are exclusive underworld enemies, only found in the 
final dungeon of the game, Death Mountain. They are pains in the butt to fight, 
and often guard key areas of Death Mountain, meaning you can't really avoid 
them, you HAVE to fight them. The thing with them is, these pieces of brown 
debris circle them, protecting them like a shield from sustaining any damage 
until they are all defeated. They circle quickly around him in orbit, and do 
some good damage when they hit Link. With the Magical Sword, each piece of 
debris takes two hits, so be patient! When all the debris is cleared from 
orbit, move in to hit the defenseless eyeball of the Patra, which takes three 
hits with the Magical Sword to slay.

----------

-Name: TRAPS
-Description: "Somebody places these in the labyrinths a long time ago. They 
suddenly attack Link when he approaches them. So you've really got to watch 
out!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Traps are just like Stone Statues - dungeon regulars who 
can't be defeated, or even stopped or stunned, by any weapon or item in Link's 
arsenal. When you walk in front of one (in any of the four primary directions) 
they'll shoot at Link with incredible speed, attempting to cut him up and do 
pretty good damage to him. They're especially dangerous when they're on either 
side of you and manage to pincer Link and damage him for twice as much! The 
best bet with them is to trigger them, then move back, and then as they try to 
get back into position, move across their line of sight, so that they can't do 
anything about it. Just be weary of them, especially when you enter a new room 
in a dungeon... they often try to be sneaky, being placed right by entrances 
all over the dungeon.

----------

-Name: VIRE
-Description: "Vire is a devil that controls the Keeses. When Link cuts it with 
his sword, it turns into two Keeses. Keeses have little attacking power, but 
Vire is a little stronger."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Vires are simply larger versions of the Keese enemy, the bat-
like enemy that you find in every dungeon in the game. Vires, however, are far 
larger and far stronger versions of the Keese, that can actually do good damage 
to you. They hop around and try to run into Link when he's in the room. When 
you hack at them and hit them, they split into two red Keeses, slightly faster 
versions of the regular old black/blue Keese that we're used to seeing. When 
they split into these red Keeses, finish them both off, to end the life of the 
Vire for good. They can be pains in the butt for sure, but are mainstays in 
many of the dungeons in the game, starting with dungeon four, and going all the 
way to Death Mountain.

----------

-Name: WALL MASTER
-Description: "A monster hand that appears out of the labyrinth wall. If it 
catches Link, it takes him back to the entrance of the labyrinth."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Wall Masters are dungeon regulars that can be a real pain in 
the neck at times. They force you to be on your toes at all times. They 
especially like to guard the rooms just before the bosses lair, making your 
life that much more difficult. They don't have an attack, exactly. Instead, if 
they capture Link, they drag him all the way back to the entrance of the 
dungeon, forcing you to get all the way back to where you were from the 
beginning. While you don't have to do certain things you've already done in the 
dungeon again if you get taken back, it's still an annoyance that you don't 
really need. Attacking them is dangerous, because if you get too close, you'll 
get captured. Instead, keep your distance, and do your best to avoid them all 
together.

----------

-Name: WIZZROBE
-Description: "The Master of Movement. He appears here and there letting out 
magic spells that Link's little shield can't hold back. He's pretty strong. 
Watch out!"
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Ohhhh Wizzrobes... god almighty, I hate Wizzrobes. Wizzrobes, 
in most anyone's opinion who has a brain, is the most annoying and difficult 
enemy in the game, including bosses. Wizzrobes are POWERFUL, and use magic and 
teleportation to do their damage. These 8-bit incarnations of the annoying 
enemy found all over Zelda games on every platform are probably their most 
annoying form, and in this game, they come in two varities. The first variety, 
the red version, can be killed in one hit with the Magical Sword, but shoots 
powerful magical energy at Link, and can do several hearts worth of damage. 
When he shoots, he promptly disappears, and reappears to do this again. The 
blue ones take three hits with the Magical Sword, and teleport around the room 
more often, but they are visable during teleportation. Every once in a while, 
they'll shoot magical energy at Link in huge bursts, which enables them to 
basically wipe you out in no time if you aren't lucky. Use your Magic Shield to 
block their attacks, and attack them quickly, and with great accuracy. I 
promise you if you aren't careful with Wizzrobes, they will take you out before 
you know what hit you. And that's no joke.

----------

-Name: ZOL
-Description: "Jelly-like monsters that walk about bouncing around in the 
labyrinths. When Link cuts Zol, it splits into two Gels. Gel has little 
attacking power, but Zol has twice the power of Gel."
-Location: Underworld
-Battle Strategy: Zols are just as easy as their smaller counterparts, Gels. 
The difference is their size and speed. Zols move around a bit quicker, and are 
several times larger than Gels, making them almost as big as Link himself. 
That's not a big deal, however, for with the White Sword, one hit does the Zol 
in, and he doesn't even split into little Gels either. With the Wooden Sword, 
one hit makes Zol split into two Gels, which you then have to give the beatdown 
to as well, to make them ALL go away. That's why the White Sword is so damn 
useful! =D

----------

-Name: ZOLA
-Description: "Half-fish, half-woman who lives in the water. When she sticks 
here head out of the water she lets out a ball that Link's little shield can't 
hold back."
-Location: Overworld
-Battle Strategy: "Zola is exclusivly a water enemy, which means that you can 
only damage and kill a Zola with a bow and arrow. When a Zola peeps her head 
out of the water, she shoots a fireball in the general direction of Link, then 
promptly sticks her head back under the water. There's honestly not much you 
can do about here, except block her fireballs with your shield and move on. If 
you're patient, whip out the bow and arrow and have a few shots at her, but 
it's not worth it, so I wouldn't even bother.

This section of the guide is information on all of the bosses in the game. They 
are in order of dungeons, so the first dungeon boss is first, sequentially.

-Name: AQUAMENTUS
-Description: A Dragon-like enemy with three heads.
-Location: Dungeon One (The Eagle), Dungeon Seven (The Demon)
-Battle Strategy: Aquamentus is the first boss battle in the game, and is 
relativly easy. He moves around very little, staying at the righthand side of 
the room guarding the doorway there, and shoots three fireballs out of its 
three heads at the enemy, which are easy to avoid. Move in close with your 
White Sword and hack him three times to take him down. If you have full hearts, 
you have the option to fight him from afar by using Sword Beams, but it takes 
six hits or so to defeat him that way. You might as well just move in close and 
go for the kill. You'll get hit, but it's easier, and he only does half a 
heart's worth of damage each time he hits you with the Blue Ring equipped, 
which you should have by the time you visit the first dungeon.

-----

-Name: DODONGO
-Description: He looks like a Rhino... what else can be said?
-Location: Dungeon Two (The Moon)
-Battle Strategy: The Dodongo is a common enemy in dungeons later in the game, 
but in dungeon two, he is the boss character. He can't be harmed at all by any 
weapon in the game, except one - the Bombs. While you can explode the bomb 
behind him and damage him with the sword whilst he's paralyzed, it's easier to 
put the bomb in front of him as he walks. When he walks to the bomb, he'll eat 
it and it'll explode inside of him. Two bombs like this, and he'll take a fall 
for good. He could be considered easier than Aquamentus, but I think they are 
both equally as easy. Not to say any of the bosses in this game are 
particularly hard... none of 'em are. 

-----

-Name: MANHANDLA
-Description: Big blue creature... has hands that look like oysters... four of 
'em.
-Location: Dungeon Three (The Manji)
-Battle Strategy: Manhandla isn't a difficult boss to defeat at all. While he 
has plenty of speed in battle, he doesn't have any active attacks, other than 
the random fireball. He just tries to run into you while you are battling him, 
which is how he damages and kills his enemies. The trick is to use bombs on 
him. Place a bomb in his path so that it'll explode when his body is over it. 
If you do it JUST right, one bomb shot will kill him right away. If you don't 
do it right, it'll still blow off a few of his limbs. Then you can finish him 
off with your sword, or use another bomb, if you're into the whole pyrotechnic 
scene. =)

-----

-Name: GLEEOK
-Description: Kind of looks like Aquamentus, just more menacing looking... 
plus, he's blue, not green like Aquamentus.
-Location: Dungeon Four (The Snake), Dungeon Eight (The Lion)
-Battle Strategy: Gleeok is the hardest boss that you've come across yet, after 
a streak of three painfully easy bosses. Gleeok fights a lot like Aquamentus, 
the boss of the first dungeon, in that he stays still and shoots fireballs at 
you, and you simply have to avoid them and get some attacks of your own in on 
him. If you have full energy when you enter this battle, then stand directly in 
front of him, as far away as you can from him, and shoot sword beams at him. 
That way, you can damage him from a distance, and be far enough from him that 
you can avoid his attacks. If you aren't full on energy, then get in close and 
hack away at him. When you do enough damage, his head flies off and turns red, 
shooting fireballs at you while you try to do damage to the body of the beast. 
Just trade blows with him and you'll come out victorious... just make sure you 
go into battle with Gleeok with a full energy meter if at all possible. It can 
make all the difference.

-----

-Name: DIGDOGGER
-Description: Looks like a big red, orange and yellow eyeball... but the 
instruction booklet says it's some sort of Sea Urchin. Go figure with these 8-
bit graphics. =)
-Location: Dungeon Five (The Lizard)
-Battle Strategy: Digdogger is a very easy boss to defeat. When you encounter 
him in the fifth dungeon in the game, make sure you have the Whistle on you and 
equipped that you should find earlier in that same dungeon. When you enter the 
battle with him, blow that Whistle right away, and watch as the big, mighty 
Digdogger becomes a little, small, weak and insignificant Digdogger, who can't 
do much to battle you except sit there, and move around, letting the statues 
that accompany him in his lair attack you from all angles, while he tries to 
avoid the wrath of your mighty blade. In this state, simply run up to him and 
slash him twice with the mighty Magical Sword, and he'll fall quickly. This 
boss battle shouldn't take you more than ten seconds TOPS, and not even if 
you're half-way decent at videogames... y'know, not to put any pressure on you 
or anything. =)

-----

-Name: GOHMA
-Description: He's basically a crab-loooking enemy... easy enough to describe, 
surprisingly enough.
-Location: Dungeon Six (The Dragon)
-Battle Strategy: Gohma is really easy to defeat, for a boss found as late in 
the game as he is. Gohma runs around horizontally, and shoots fireballs at his 
foe(s) from the crab-like pinchers he has as hands. He can battle with his eye 
shut (he only has one eye, yes), but when he opens his eye, that's when he's 
vulnerable to your attacks. Make sure to have the bow and arrow equipped while 
you are fighting him, so that you are ready to shoot one at his open eye, which 
kills the "mighty" Gohma in one hit... making him the biggest chump boss in the 
game, if you ask me. Well... you didn't ask me, did you. But I'm telling you 
anyway!

-----

-Name: GANON
-Description: This pig-looking enemy, the nemesis of Hyrule.
-Location: Dungeon Nine (Death Mountain)
-Battle Strategy: Ganon is the final boss in the game, and comes in two forms 
for you to fight, both of which are fairly easy indeed. When the battle begins, 
Ganon has the power to teleport around the room, and make himself invisible, 
shooting fireballs all around the room at Link. The only way to stop this is to 
stab your sword around the room until you happen to hit him, which will make 
him reappear. But then, he'll disappear again, and you'll have to do it all 
over. It takes four hits like this with the Magical Sword to stop this battle 
strategy, which then turns him a shade of brown. When he turns this color, 
equip the Bow and Silver Arrow on Link right away, and give him one good shot 
with the Silver Arrow, which will end Ganon's reign of terror, and turn him 
into nothing more than a big pile of dust. Now that he's defeated (for now, he 
reappears in like ten more Zelda games ^_^), go rescue Princess Zelda in the 
next room! Go ahead! What are you waiting for!

The Dungeon Archive section that you are now reading is a simple archive of the 
maps of each dungeon, just in case you don't want the full walkthrough and 
rundown of the dungeons found in the walkthrough, but rather just some guidance 
via a short description and map of each dungeon. Hope it helps.

-----

DUNGEON ONE - "The Eagle"
------- ---    --- -----

The first dungeon is naturally the easiest dungeon in the game, with few 
secrets, and no twists at all. Be weary to get the Bow, however. It's a vital 
weapon, and you can defeat the boss of the dungeon, Aquamentus, without it... 
but you need it, so make sure to get it.

-----

DUNGEON TWO - "The Moon"
------- ---    --- ----

The second dungeon is a slight progression in difficulty and size from the 
first dungeon, but it's still easy and straight-forward. Enjoy the easyness and 
straight-forwardness now, though... it quickly fades in the later, larger, more 
complex dungeons.

DUNGEON THREE - "The Manji"
------- -----    --- -----

The Manji dungeon is when the dungeons start to get a bit more complicated, a 
bit larger in size, and where the enemies start to get more difficult as well. 
However, what's really startling about this dungeon is its shape. Yes it's a 
manji, but what ELSE is it. Where's the discretion on the part of Nintendo when 
they were making this game? Making it in this shape is just plain wrong, no 
matter what else it means. It can be a manji, but it's also synonomous with 
hatred, something we don't need in this world. Regardless... whatever.

-----

DUNGEON FOUR - "The Snake"
------- ----    --- -----

The fourth dungeon is where the game starts to get noticably harder. The 
enemies within the dungeon are pretty difficult, and you'll even run into past 
dungeon bosses that are now just regular old enemies! Heh heh. Anyway, this 

dungeon is just harder, it's not any bigger or more complicated than the last 
dungeon. Just wait until the dungeons are both hard and maze-like. That's when 
the games starts to become a pain in the ass. =)

-----

DUNGEON FIVE - "The Lizard"
------- ----    --- ------

The fifth dungeon can get a bit confusing indeed, which is why the map you see 
below that I've made for you guys is that much more useful. While the dungeon 
doesn't boast any new powerful underworld enemies (although it does mark the 
first time you see any Gibdos and Pols Voices), the growing size of the 
dungeons as you get to each one make the game more difficult... just make sure 
to find the Whistle... it's vital in defeating the dungeon boss, Digdogger!

-----

DUNGEON SIX - "The Dragon"
------- ---    --- ------

The sixth dungeon is the biggest pain in the ass dungeon in the game, and not 
because it's necessarily the hardest dungeon in the game, but rather because 
it's such a big jump in difficulty, from the fifth dungeon to this one. In this 
dungeon, you fight the most annoying enemies in the game - Wizzrobes. There is 
such a huge volume of enemies in this dungeon, and they are pretty difficult, 
that it makes this dungeon incredibly annoying, but not entirely impossible. 
Not impossible at all... at least Gohma, the boss of this dungeon, is easy as 
anything to defeat.

-----

DUNGEON SEVEN - "The Demon"
------- -----    --- -----

The seventh dungeon is surprisingly easy, for one found this far in the game, 
and especially the fact that it's after dungeon six, which was like a thorn in 
my side compared to dungeon seven, a relativly straightforward and easy 
dungeon. You just have to keep your eyes open and try lots of things in the 
seventh dungeon, because there are lots of bombable walls and such for you to 
fool with. Also, make sure to give the monster the Monster Bait so he'll move, 
or you won't be getting very far! Other than that, the dungeon is easy, and the 
dungeon's boss, Aquamentus, is identical to the Aquamentus we fought in the 
first dungeon. Can you say "easy" ? =)

DUNGEON EIGHT - "The Lion"
------- -----    --- ----

This dungeon is the final dungeon before going to Death Mountain. It's small 
and pretty straightforward, and you can actually avoid going to a lot of rooms 
in the dungeon, because there are so many side rooms and such. There are two 
vital items in this dungeon - the Magic Book and the Magic Key, both of which 
you should absolutly find before leaving here en route to Death Mountain. Other 
than that, enjoy the simplicity of this dungeon now... you'll be yearning for 
it when you get to Death Mountain. =)

DUNGEON NINE - "Death Mountain"
------- ----    ----- --------

Ah yes, the infamous Death Mountain... this dungeon is huge, and is actually 
shaped like Ganon's head... as for an explanation of the map below... here's a 
copy of my "note" about the Death Mountain walkthrough, which explains the 
segemented style I went for with this massive dungeon:

NOTE: The map of the final dungeon is laid out a bit differently than the 
previous eight dungeon maps I've provided you with in the walkthrough. Being 
that Death Mountain is so massive, and you can avoid going to most of it en 
route to slaying Ganon, I've mapped out the parts you need to go to, and 
nothing more. The "T1", "T2", et cetera, are teleports, so to speak, like we've 
seen in other dungeons. Since there are so many, and they lead straight across 
this massive dungeon, I've now put them on the map. Therefore, T1 in one place 
corresponds with T1 in another place. As the map segements go down, you are 
farther into the dungeon, so they are also in sequential order, for ease. Hope 
they help.

This section of the guide holds the shop information. Basically, each shop in 
the world holds three items. Not all items are the same price, you can shop 
around and find certain items for better prices than at other places. Each shop 
below is in order of the way you find them in the game, from first to last. 
Each shop is given a name of simple "Shop _____", with the underline being the 
number. Next to each shop is a set of coordinates, which can be matched up to 
the shop's location via the map at the top of the walkthrough section, for your 
ease and convenience. With the items themselves, the item is listed, and in 
parenthesis are the price, in rupees.

This part of the walkthrough is a short list of "Old Man" quotes, quotes that 
the mysterious old man in the game gives you in dungeons. They are in order of 
the dungeon they are in.

Dungeon One - "Eastmost penninsula is the secret." (note the spelling mistake,

1.) Q - Why all of the commotion before getting to the first dungeon?

    A - Many Zelda players that are playing for the first time shoot right to 
the first dungeon. But why do that, when you can upgrade your sword, shield, 
get three hearts, and other useful items, before you even get to the first 
dungeon? This way, it's easier for you to defeat, and you're better prepared 
and equipped. If you're looking for a challenge, then you don't have to do it 
that way, but it's plenty worth it, trust me.

2.) Q - How come after I shoot my Blue Candle once, it doesn't work again?

    A - With the Blue Candle, once you shoot it on a screen, you have to leave 
that screen and come back if you want to use it again on that screen. It's 
strictly one shot per screen. The Red Candle, on the other hand, takes care of 
that problem, with its unlimited shot capability.

3.) Q - I bought the arrows, but how come I can't shoot any?

    A - The thing with arrows is that each time you shoot one, it takes away 
one rupee. So eventually, if you keep shooting your Bow and Arrow, you're going 
to run out of rupees. Hence, if you have no rupees, you technically have no 
arrows. That's just how it works. =)

4.) Q - Is it possible to hold more Bombs than just 8 in your inventory?

    A - Indeed it is. There are two bomb upgrades in the game, both found in 
dungeons later in the game (the first is in the fifth dungeon). The Old Man 
that offers these upgrades in the dungeons charges you 100 rupees, and brings 
your bomb holding capacity first from 8 to 12, and then later, from 12 to 16. 
It's quite useful, indeed!

Well my friends, it's time to close this guide out! =) I hope you found it very 
helpful... I very much enjoyed writing it. It was fun, as is the game, and I'm 
sure that it was/is/will be enjoyable for you as well. And hey, if you have 
game related questions, comments, suggestions - whatever, e-mail them my way, 
cmoriarty311@cs.com. And make sure to put Zelda (or whatever game you're 
writing in on, I have nineteen other guides), in the header as the topic, so I 
know what the hell you're talking about. =) Take it easy.
	
I'd like to take this chance to thank a friend of mine, Devin Morgan, a fellow 
FAQ writer on GameFAQs, for just being a good guy, a good friend, and someone I 
can talk to about everything. Thanks Dev. Also, thanks goes out to Adrenaline, 
'cause she's so damn cute.

One final thank you goes out, once again, to Astro Blue and Shdwrlm3, for 
offering me use of some of their formatting from their Zelda OoS/OoA FAQs, 
which I gladly accepted. Thanks guys!

Also, thanks to Nintendo for making such a great game. The Instruction Manual 
and map that came with the game was a big help too. Thanks Nintendo!

[accurate as of August 08, 2002]

I'm a 17 year old, and just graduated from high school. I live on Long Island, 
in New York, about half an hour from New York City. I play ice hockey, I worked 
at a deli, until recently, when I quit (^_^) and I love videogames, especially 
RPGs. My favorite series for videogames include the Final Fantasy series 
(excluding VIII), the Dragon Warrior/Quest series, the Mega Man series, and the 
Tales series. I aspire to go to Northeastern University in the fall of 2002 to 
study History and Law.

THANKS FOR READING!
